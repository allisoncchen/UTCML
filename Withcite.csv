We aimed to summarize how content related to substances is portrayed on various social media platforms. Methods: This systematic review was pre‐registered on PROSPERO (ref: CRD42021291853). A comprehensive search was conducted in the databases of PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and Web of Science in April 2021. Original qualitative studies published post‐2004 that included thematic and sentiment analyses of social media content on tobacco, alcohol, psychostimulant, e‐cigarette, cannabis, opiate, stimulant/amphetamine, inhalant and novel psychoactive substance were included. Social media platforms were defined as online web‐ or application‐based platforms that allowed users to generate content and interact via 'liking', comment or messaging features. Only studies that included summative and/or thematic content analyses of substance‐related social media content were included. Results: A total of 73 studies, which covered 15 905 182 substance‐related posts on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok and Weibo, were identified. A total of 76.3% of all substance‐related content was positive in its depiction of substance use, with 20.2% of content depicting use negatively. Sentiment regarding opiate use however was commonly negative (55.5%). Most studies identified themes relating to Health, Safety and Harms (65.0%) of substance use. Themes relating to Promotions/Advertisements (63.3%), Informative content (55.0%) and Use behaviours (43.3%) were also frequently identified. Conclusions: Substance‐related content that promotes engagement with substance use or actively depicts use appears to be widely available on social media. The large public presence of this content may have concerning influences on attitudes, behaviours and risk perceptions relating to substance use, particularly among the most vulnerable and heaviest users of social media—adolescents and young adults.

Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p =.0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02–1.09, p =.00258). Medical Twitter experienced a 37% quarterly increase in destigmatizing tweet frequency (IRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15–1.64, p =.00291), and Public Health a 16% increase (IRR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.11–1.20, p =0.00000000373). Unfortunately, a regression discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Health's use of destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19. While the longitudinal findings are promising, they also indicate a need for increased efforts to encourage broader use of destigmatizing language, especially post-COVID.

SNS have also become an important aspect of the alcohol industry’s multi-platform marketing strategies, which may contribute to the creation of intoxigenic digital spaces in which young people learn about alcohol. This paper presents findings of a content analysis of the extent, nature, and user interaction with SNS-based alcohol marketing for brands popular among young people in the UK. It provides a systematic analysis of both official and user generated marketing content on brand Facebook and Twitter profiles, and user interaction with such content. Findings from peer group interviews (N = 14) also present young people’s (N = 70) perspectives and experiences regarding alcohol marketing on SNS. New SNS engagement marketing strategies extended existing multi-platform brand marketing. Young people interacted with such strategies as part of their identity-making practices, yet through a discourse of immaturity distanced themselves from certain brands, online marketing practices and the idea that their own actions were influenced by marketing. Local night life economy marketing appeared more meaningful and relevant to young people and led to further interaction with brand marketing. Implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the influence of alcohol marketing on young people, and the implications for current regulatory frameworks.

In this piece the authors consider derogatory, harmful messages on the social media platform, Twitter, that target one of three groups of women, Asians, Blacks, and Latinx. The research focuses on messages that include one of the most common female slurs, ""b!tch."" The findings of this chapter reveal that aggressive messages oriented toward women of color can be vicious and easily accessible (located in fewer than 30 seconds). Using an intersectional approach, the authors note the distinctive experiences of online harassment for women of color. The findings highlight the manner in which detrimental stereotypes are reinforced, including that of the ""eroticized and obedient Asian woman,"" the ""angry Black woman,"" and the ""poor Latinx woman."" In some exceptions, women use the term ""b!tch"" in a positive and empowering manner, likely in an attempt to ""reclaim"" one of the common words used to attack females. Applying a social network perspective, we illustrate the tendency of typically hostile tweets to develop into interactive network conversations, where the original message spreads beyond the victim, and in the case of public individuals, quite widely. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the processes that lead to online harassment, including the fortification of typical norms and social dominance. Finally, the authors find that messages that use the word ""b!tch"" to insult Asian, Black, and Latinx women are particularly damaging in that they reinforce traditional stereotypes of women and ethno-racial minorities, and these messages possess the ability to extend to wider audiences.

Even though much of the work on intersectionality has been carried out by scholars from the United States with specific emphasis on gender and race, this framework can be applied universally to understand the multiple axes of power within a society that results in further marginalisation of certain groups of women. The 16th December 2012 Nirbhaya rape case forms the core of this chapter as it resulted in one of the biggest gender movements in India. Design/methodology/approach: In order to develop a critical analysis a case study approach was adopted and data collected by analysing online news reports, videos, articles on blogs and posts on social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter. Findings: The findings of the research showed interesting intersections of gender and class with relation to this case, which has not been deeply analysed in order to understand the reasons behind the public uprising which resulted in the government action. Originality/value: It is important to look at gender violence in India through the lens of intersectionality since often it is the result of multiple levels of discrimination on the basis of class, caste, religion and geography. This is important to recognise in order to ensure that activism, education and changes in policy help to resolve problems related to extreme oppression and violence against women across the country.

This article takes the stance that African feminism(s) exist, that empirical study of lived experiences of African women should define it, and not perspectives that reject and argue that feminism comes from the other.

Apologists for white supremacist violence tend to reject the truism that Black Lives Matter by countering with All Lives Matter as if the later could hold if the former is rejected. In other words, since All Lives Matter, it follows that Black Lives Matter too and if by any logic Black Lives do not Matter, then All Lives do not Matter. The reason why it is even necessary to state what should be obvious, that Black Lives Matter, is exactly because there are still people who believe that certain lives belong to the homo sacer and are disposable to be taken without any consequences. This editorial complicates this issue by demonstrating the theory of Martin Luther King Jr. that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. By treating Black Lives as if they do not Matter, the lives of human beings everywhere are threatened and so all should rally in support of Black Lives in the interest of humanity.

Our analysis shows that 'personal concerns/views' and 'health and social care' are the predominant overall topics, although some topics are clearly linked with specific keywords. The language often used in the tweets seems to reinforce negative discourses of age and ageing that locate older adults as a disempowered, vulnerable and homogeneous group; old age is deemed a problem and ageing is considered something that needs to be resisted, slowed or disguised. These topics and discursive patterns are indeed similar to those found in empirical studies of social perceptions and traditional media portrayal of old age, which indicates that social media and Twitter in particular appears to serve as an online platform that reproduces and reinforces existing ageist discourses in traditional media that feed into social perceptions of ageing and older people.

Social media content about older people has become important for understanding media representations of older people, but it has not been sufficiently studied. Recent studies suggest that older people are predominantly represented as a disempowered, vulnerable and homogeneous group on social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Because local authorities in many countries have begun using Facebook to reach out to and interact with citizens, they are seen as a significant producer of media content about older people and later life. The purpose of this study is to examine the ways in which Swedish local authorities have visually portrayed older people in their use of Facebook compared with other age groups. This research performed a visual content analysis of 1,000 Facebook posts posted by 33 Swedish local authorities, employing ten analytical aspects to describe and interpret the signs, activities and contexts associated with older people and other age groups (infants, children, adolescents and adults). The study found that the representations of older people on the Facebook pages of local authorities appeared to be not very diverse; specifically, older people (including those in residential care homes) were mainly portrayed as remaining socially engaged and moderately physically capable. This media representation destabilised the prevalent negative stereotypes of older people as being out of touch and dependent; however, it collided with the reality of older individuals with care needs. Additionally, this study argues that older people are represented as inferior to the young in terms of physical and technological competence, based on the connotations of the signs. Given that local authorities have progressively incorporated social media into their daily work, it is expected that this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the ways in which local authorities produce (non-)stereotypical representations of older people on social media.

Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, present accessible and low-cost communication technologies that have been demonstrated to enhance feelings of social connection and reduce loneliness in younger age groups. This exploratory study uses a four-week social media training workshop as an intervention in a randomised controlled study to examine whether similar social benefits might be realised for those at older ages, aged 65+ years. Social wellbeing measures of social capital, loneliness, social connectedness and social provisions were examined, revealing only small differences in social integration. As these findings seemingly contradict studies conducted with younger persons, the contexts of social media use in older adulthood are discussed, along with proposals for future research directions.

At the same time, the dark side of this growth/benefit has led to increased hate speech and terrorism as most common and powerful threats globally. Hate speech is an offensive kind of communication mechanism that expresses an ideology of hate using stereotypes. Hate speech targets different protected characteristics such as gender, religion, race, and disability. Control of hate speech can be made using different national and international legal frameworks. Any intentional act directed against life or related entities causing a common danger is known as terrorism. There is a common practice of discussing or debating hate speech and terrorism separately. In the recent past, most of the research articles have discussed either hate speech or terrorism. Hate speech is a type of terrorism and follows an incident or trigger event of terrorism. Online social networks are the result of ITs and evolved rapidly through the popularity among youth. As both the activities are near to close and makes use of online social networks, the collective discussion is appropriate. Therefore we have a review on hate speech with different classes and terrorism with cyber use in the framework of online social networks. With the help of combined effort from the government, the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and online social networks, the proper policies can be framed to counter both hate speech and terrorism efficiently and effectively.

Moral claims about hunger on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic,AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES,10.1007/s10460-022-10333-2,,"How do crisis conditions affect longstanding societal narratives about hunger? This paper examines how hunger was framed in public discourse during an early period in the COVID-19 crisis to mobilize attention and make moral claims on others to alleviate it. It does so through a discourse analysis of 1023 U.S.-based English-language posts dedicated to hunger on Twitter during four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis finds that Twitter users chiefly adopted hunger as a political tool to make moral claims on the state rather than individuals, civil society organizations, or corporations; however, hunger was deployed to defend widely diverse political agendas ranging from progressive support for SNAP entitlements to conservative claims reinforcing anti-lockdown and racist ""America First"" sentiments. Theoretically, the paper contributes to understanding how culture and morality operate in times of crisis. It demonstrates how culture can be deployed in crisis to reinforce longstanding ideological commitments at the same time that it organizes political imaginations in new ways. The result, in this case, is that longstanding cultural narratives about hunger were used to defend dissimilar, and in some ways contradictory, political ends. Practically, the paper demonstrates how moralized calls to alleviate hunger are vulnerable to political manipulation and used to further conflicting political goals, yet may also offer opportunities to leverage support for bolstered state investments in food assistance during times of crisis.",Social media; Culture; Discourse analysis; FOOD; Food Insecurity; Hunger; RIGHTS,WOS,,,,,,,,

However, empirical research on this matter remains scarce. This paper fills this gap by examining the case of Februdairy, a Twitter hashtag campaign to promote the British dairy industry, hijacked by animal protection activists. For this case, I employ the relational perspective on technology affordances-as operationalised by Faraj and Azad (in: Leonard et al. (eds), Materiality and organizing. Social interaction in a technological world, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2012)-to highlight two distinct strategic modes of embracement of social media functionalities by the opposing groups: hashtag hijacking and crowdsourcing transparency.

We collected 931,363 public tweets (original posts and replies) over a period of 1 month that mentioned at least one of 101 influential women in India. By undertaking both manual and automated text analysis of ""hateful"" tweets, we identified three broad types of violence experienced by women of influence on Twitter: dismissive insults, ethnoreligious slurs, and gendered sexual harassment. The analysis also revealed different types of individually motivated offenders: ""news junkies,"" ""Bollywood fanatics,"" and ""lone-wolves"", who do not characteristically engage in direct targeted attacks against a single person. Finally, we question the effectiveness of Twitter's form of ""guardianship"" against online violence against women, as we found that a year after our initial data collection in 2017, only 22% of hostile posts with explicit forms of harassment have been deleted. We conclude that in the social media age, online and offline public spheres overlap and intertwine, requiring improved regulatory approaches, policies, and moderation tools of ""capable"" guardianship that empower women to actively participate in public life.

Tweets and retweets combined used acclaims more than attacks. Tweets used more acclaims, and fewer attacks, than retweets. Incumbent candidates acclaimed more, and attacked less, than challengers. These campaign messages addressed character slightly more than policy. Tweets acclaimed more than they attacked when addressing general goals and ideals. Incumbents (compared with challengers) were more likely to acclaim, and less likely to attack, when discussing past deeds.

The phenomenon of motivated processing, however, is understudied particularly in the context of televised presidential debates. As major campaign events, presidential debates have been linked to increases in viewers’ political knowledge, political information efficacy, and changes in candidate evaluation. Yet individual’s information processing, largely unexplored in the extant debate literature, may well influence these outcomes. In the present study, we manipulate processing of a political debate and monitor the effects through participant engagement with social media. Researchers asked debate viewers to tweet while watching 2016 Democrat and Republican presidential primary debates following instructions designed to prime either directional motivated processing or accuracy motivated processing. The results demonstrate that the accuracy prompt reduced issue-based tweeting and therefore reduced knowledge acquisition. Conversely, the directional prompt increased issue-based tweeting and therefore increased knowledge acquisition.

What remains unclear, though, is the extent to which there was any direct interaction between these two groups (especially considering potential language barriers between them). Building on hashtag data sets gathered between January and November 2011, this article compares patterns of Twitter usage during the popular revolution in Egypt and the civil war in Libya. Using custom-made tools for processing “big data,” we examine the volume of tweets sent by English-, Arabic-, and mixed-language Twitter users over time and examine the networks of interaction (variously through @replying, retweeting, or both) between these groups as they developed and shifted over the course of these uprisings.

We analyzed who the top 50 Spanish generalist media with most followers started following in 2017, 2018, and 2019 on Twitter, the quintessential informational network. To do so, we melded data visualization computational and manual methods. We used an artificial intelligence big data analysis software to visualize the network of media from Spain in order to identify the sample. Afterward, we extracted the top followed accounts by the sample and categorized them in types of accounts, institution/citizenship, country, number of followers, and gender, to proceed with the data visualization to identify trends and patterns. The results show that these media accounts started following mainly accounts that belonged to male politicians from Spain. We could also spot among the years of the study an inversely proportional trend from the media that went from following mainly institutions to following a majority of citizens, and to start following more accounts with a smaller number of followers every year. The tendency to follow accounts from Spain that belong to men grew or remained a majority among the years of the study.

All tweets containing the hashtag #CPC, representing the Conservative Party of Canada (government), and #NDP, representing the New Democratic Party of Canada (official opposition), were collected over a 2-week period in March 2013 and a follower network graph was created. Social network analysis and content analysis were employed to identify influentials. Kendall’s τ was the primary quantitative measure for comparison. Categorization of Twitter profiles of users found within the top 20 most influential lists, according to each metric of influence, made up the qualitative portion of analysis. The authors find that measures of centrality—indegree and eigenvector centrality—identify the traditional political elite (media outlets, journalists, politicians) as influential, whereas measures considering the quality of messages and interactions provide a different group of influencers, including political commentators and bloggers. Finally, the authors investigate the possibility of using the local clustering coefficient of nodes to identify those who are both aware of the traditional elite and embedded in tightly knit communities, similar to the “opinion leader,” described in the Two-Step Flow Hypothesis.

Tests of bivariate association carried out for individual states lead to widely varying results, indicating an underlying diversity of legislative environments. However, a pooled multivariate analysis for all 50 states indicates that constituents per legislator, the youth and educational attainment of a district, legislative professionalism, being a woman, sitting in the upper chamber, leadership, and legislative inexperience are significantly and positively associated with Twitter adoption and current Twitter use. Controlling for these factors, neither legislator party, nor majority status, nor partisan instability, nor district income is significantly related to either Twitter adoption or current Twitter use. Although women are more likely than men to adopt and use Twitter, the most active users narrowly tend to be men. Finally, most variation in social media adoption and activity by legislators remains unexplained, leaving considerable room for further theoretical development.

In this context, our proposal is to track constitutive parts of this process of ""deception"" with Morrissey, focusing specifically on a phenomenon that has gained visibility on socio-technical networks: the idea of ""canceling."" To gauge the reaction of his fandom, we address this event from the perception that this response to the singer took place on the horizon of expectations constructed through the experience that fans had with his career over the decades.

For these reasons, Twitter is an appropriate field for analyzing the influences of the Internet on the formation of public opinion. By integrating social investigation and behavioral log analysis, we test a model that incorporates an individual's attitudes (measured via a questionnaire) and an individual's communication network structure and actual communication behavior (measured via behavior log analysis). The results from our analysis show a positive correlation between individuals' perception that their opinion represents the majority view and the number of times they have spoken out. Moreover, while homogeneity of opinions of a personal network on Twitter influenced speaking out by a majority group, homogeneity of opinions does not influence speaking out by a minority group.

Many nations imposed strict lockdowns and quarantines, causing citizens to maintain social isolation, throwing many companies to a halt. Thousands of people took to Twitter during these challenging circumstances to express their feelings about being caught in the middle of a storm. Twitter witnessed an outpouring of emotions ranging from fear, anger, and sadness associated with the spread of a novel virus that has no known cure, to voices of support and trust for nations' official response to the pandemic. In studying the emotional response (anger, fear, and sadness) on Twitter about the COVID-19 crisis, we thus see a tale of two crises unfold—choosing health or economy. We capture collective emotions on social media and investigate the patterns and impact of these negative emotions during various stages of the disease outbreak. It also provides crucial insights to health officials and government agencies on communicating crisis information to the public via social media.

The rise of the Internet has refocused our attention on this ongoing tension. The Internet has enabled people who know each other to use social media, from e-mail to Facebook, to interact without meeting physically. Into this mix came Twitter, an asymmetric microblogging service: If you follow me, I do not have to follow you. This means that connections on Twitter depend less on in-person contact, as many users have more followers than they know. Yet there is a possibility that Twitter can form the basis of interlinked personal communities—and even of a sense of community. This analysis of one person’s Twitter network shows that it is the basis for a real community, even though Twitter was not designed to support the development of online communities. Studying Twitter is useful for understanding how people use new communication technologies to form new social connections and maintain existing ones.

Based on content analysis of Twitter data (n = 856) and agency press releases (n = 95), this article investigates two main questions: (1) How, and to what extent, did national public health agencies coordinate their online communication with other agencies and organizations? (2) How was online communication from the agencies diversified in terms of targeting specific organizations and social groups? Our findings indicate that public health agencies relied heavily on internal scientific expertise and predominately coordinated their communication efforts with national government agencies. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that agencies in each country differed in how they diversify information; however, all agencies provided tailored information to at least some organizations and social groups. Across the three countries, information tailored for several vulnerable groups (e.g., pregnant women, people with disabilities, immigrants, and homeless populations) was largely absent, which may contribute to negative consequences for these groups.

Using a granular, four-stage construct of a crisis, results identify stage-based variation with regard to peer-to-peer and federal-to-local coordination.

However, the platform along with Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft jointly created the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism in 2017 as one mode to be more accountable and take measures toward combating extremist content online. Though extreme content on YouTube has been found to have decreased substantially due to this and other efforts (human and machine-based), it is valuable to historically review what role YouTube previously had in order to better understand the evolution of contemporary moves toward platform accountability in terms of extremist video content sharing. Therefore, this study explores what role YouTube's recommender algorithm had in directing users to ISIS-related content prior to large-scale pressure by citizens and governments to more aggressively moderate extremist content. To investigate this, a YouTube video network from 2016 consisting of 15,021 videos (nodes) and 190,087 recommendations between them (edges) was studied. Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis, this study evaluates 11 video attributes (such as genre, language, and radical keywords) and identifies sets of attributes that were found to potentially be involved in the outcomes of YouTube recommending extreme content. This historical review of YouTube at a unique point in platform accountability ultimately raises questions of how platforms might be able to be more proactive rather than reactive regarding filtering and moderating extremist content.

To examine the relationship between candidates’ on-screen behaviors and the social media response, we conduct generalized least squares regression (Prais–Winstein estimation) relating two data sources: (a) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for rhetorical/functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates’ behavior during the debates, and (b) corresponding real-time measures of the volume and valence of online expression about the candidates on Twitter. We find that the nonverbal communication behaviors of candidates—their facial expressions, physical gestures, and blink rate—are consistent, robust, and significant predictors of the volume and valence of public expression during debates, rivaling the power of memes generated by candidates and contributing more than rhetorical strategies and speech tone.

Amid the anecdotes and speculation, most of the available empirical research in this area has examined how new media have enabled participants and spectators to produce and circulate protest-related content. In contrast, the current study investigates patterns of consumption of Arab Spring–related content using a unique data set constructed by combining archived Twitter content with metadata drawn from the URL shortening service Bit.ly. This data set allows us to explore two critical research questions: First, were links posted to Twitter (among other platforms) followed primarily by individuals inside the affected country, within the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region or by those outside the region and country? And second, who attracted more attention online: protesters and other nonelite citizens or traditional news organizations? Our findings suggest that the vast majority of attention to Arab Spring content came from outside of the MENA region and, furthermore, that mass media, rather than citizen media, overwhelmingly held the world’s attention during the protests. We thus conclude that Twitter was broadly useful as an information channel for non-MENA onlookers but less so for protesters on the ground.

Drawing from theories of online activism and research on information diffusion in networks, this article centers on the following two questions: How does protest information spread in online networks? And how do different actors contribute to the growth of activity? The article aims to inform the theoretical debate on whether digital technologies are changing the logic of collective action and to provide evidence of how new media facilitates the emergence of massive offline mobilizations.

In turn, new practices are emerging that evoke innovative ways of relating among people and between individuals and places. This article investigates this geographic turn in networked interaction—particularly, emergent sensemaking regarding the role of location in distributed communities. The author uses an inductive, grounded theory methodology based on ethnographic interview and artifact data to compare the microblogging practices of two communities: those using Twitter and those using Jaiku. Findings suggest that the organizing practices of the two groups are quite different, despite the similarities in the tools they use to interact. Although each platform allows for the development of peripheral awareness and ambient intimacy within user groups, the design affordances of Twitter as a straightforward broadcasting tool result in social patterns that are quite distinct from those of Jaiku, whose design enables threaded conversation. As a result, the communal bonds among Jaiku users appear to be built on thematic, conversational interaction that relies little on shared geographical references. Twitter users, with less robust means of threaded response, tend to broadcast individual reports from various geographical outposts. Communal bonds are thus formed on the basis of recognizing the highly indexical references, which in turn reinforce a common geographical locus for the community. The article concludes with a discussion of how design, though not determinate of interaction directly, is influential in shaping social patterns that emphasize different types of communal bonds.

Through a theorization of hashtag usage, we discuss how and why social media platforms have become powerful sites for documenting and challenging episodes of police brutality and the misrepresentation of racialized bodies in mainstream media. We show how engaging in 'hashtag activism' can forge a shared political temporality, and, additionally, we examine how social media platforms can provide strategic outlets for contesting and reimagining the materiality of racialized bodies. Our analysis combines approaches from linguistic anthropology and social movements research to investigate the semiotics of digital protest and to interrogate both the possibilities and the pitfalls of engaging in 'hashtag ethnography.'

A review of the literature led to an examination of the relationship between predictor variables frequency and quality of social media communication, while using county population density and county social economic status (SES) as control variables. A hierarchical multiple linear regression model was used to evaluate the data that had been collected via a phone and online survey. All statistical requirements to use this regression model were met. Careful adherence to ethical standards was practiced. The relatively small sample resulting from the small population was cited as a concern. However, responses from 52 of the 75 Arkansas county sheriff offices provided sufficient data for the study. The predictor variable, frequency, accounted for a significant degree of variation in both dependent variables. The predictor variable, quality or variety of social media sources, was not significant, so the null hypothesis was not rejected. However, more social media sources increase the significance of the frequency. Overall, Arkansas sheriff offices surveyed supported the use of social media for both community relations and crime solving. The social media platforms identified as being used by one or more sheriff office or individual sheriff to connect with residents in their community included, a Basic Website, Electronic Newsletters, FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

Recent work indicates that community-recruited individuals report low support of research inclusion for persons reporting substance use. Objective: This study conducted a mixed-method assessment of researchers' attitudes on including persons reporting substance use in clinical research. Methods: Respondents (N = 168; 58% female; 58% psychologists) recruited via scientific society listservs and Twitter completed a survey containing two hypothetical research vignettes. Quantitative items evaluated respondents' endorsement of research participation by healthy adults, people who use drugs, and vulnerable populations. Qualitative items included open-ended questions asking reasons why people who use drugs should and should not participate in research. Results: Respondents reported significantly lower support for research participation by people who use drugs compared to healthy adults (p <.001). Open-ended responses concerning the inclusion of people who use drugs included themes relevant to the Belmont Principles (e.g., capacity to consent) and data quality (e.g., ""bad data,"" poor compliance). Conclusion: Although lower support for research participation by people who use drugs was observed compared to healthy adults, the magnitude of this difference was smaller than reported for prior community-recruited respondents. These findings emphasize salient factors that may serve as both protections for and barriers to inclusion of people who use drugs in research. Initiatives including adoption of person-first language, addressing stereotyping of people who use drugs, and emphasizing the benefits of including these populations in clinical research should be explored to reduce bias while retaining needed protections.

To examine the role that bots play in spreading vaccine information on Twitter by measuring exposure and engagement among active users from the United States. Methods. We sampled 53 188 US Twitter users and examined who they follow and retweet across 21 million vaccine-related tweets (January 12, 2017–December 3, 2019). Our analyses compared bots to human-operated accounts and vaccine-critical tweets to other vaccine-related tweets. Results. The median number of potential exposures to vaccine-related tweets per user was 757 (interquartile range [IQR] = 168–4435), of which 27 (IQR = 6–169) were vaccine critical, and 0 (IQR = 0–12) originated from bots.

To adapt and extend an existing typology of vaccine misinformation to classify the major topics of discussion across the total vaccine discourse on Twitter. Methods. Using 1.8 million vaccine-relevant tweets compiled from 2014 to 2017, we adapted an existing typology to Twitter data, first in a manual content analysis and then using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to extract 100 topics from the data set. Results. Manual annotation identified 22% of the data set as antivaccine, of which safety concerns and conspiracies were the most common themes. Seventeen percent of content was identified as provaccine, with roughly equal proportions of vaccine promotion, criticizing antivaccine beliefs, and vaccine safety and effectiveness. Of the 100 LDA topics, 48 contained provaccine sentiment and 28 contained antivaccine sentiment, with 9 containing both. Conclusions. Our updated typology successfully combines manual annotation with machine-learning methods to estimate the distribution of vaccine arguments, with greater detail on the most distinctive topics of discussion. With this information, communication efforts can be developed to better promote vaccines and avoid amplifying antivaccine rhetoric on Twitter.

Results. Tweets contained both general and hepatitis A–specific information related to the outbreak, restatements of policy and comments critical of government responses to the outbreak, information with the potential to shape risk perceptions, and expressions of concern regarding individuals experiencing homelessness and their role in spreading hepatitis A.

Combining unsupervised machine learning and network analysis to identify ""thematic personas"" (i.e., accounts that consistently share the same topics), we analyzed the ways in which each discussed vaccines. Results. We found differences in volume and valence of vaccine-related tweets among 9 thematic personas. Pro-Trump personas were more likely to express antivaccine sentiment. Anti-Trump personas expressed support for vaccination. Others offered a balanced valence, talked about vaccines neutrally, or did not tweet about vaccines. Conclusions. IRA-operated accounts discussed vaccines in manners consistent with fabricated US identities. Public Health Implications. IRA accounts discussed vaccines online in ways that evoked political identities. This could exacerbate recently emerging partisan gaps relating to vaccine misinformation, as differently valenced messages were targeted at different segments of the US public.

We conducted a content analysis of a Twitter hashtag associated with Russian troll activity. Results. Compared with average users, Russian trolls (χ2(1) = 102.0; P < .001), sophisticated bots (χ2(1) = 28.6; P< .001), and “content polluters” (χ2(1) = 7.0; P<.001) tweeted about vaccination at higher rates. Whereas content polluters posted more antivaccine content (χ2(1) = 11.18; P< .001), Russian trolls amplified both sides. Unidentifiable accounts were more polarized (χ2(1) = 12.1; P< .001) and antivaccine (χ2(1) = 35.9; P< .001). Analysis of the Russian troll hashtag showed that its messages were more political and divisive. Conclusions. Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated antivaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord. Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination. Public Health Implications. Directly confronting vaccine skeptics enables bots to legitimize the vaccine debate. More research is needed to determine how best to combat bot-driven content.

Researchers have used traditional databases to study public health for decades. Less is known about the use of social media data sources, such as Twitter, for this purpose. Objectives. To systematically review the use of Twitter in health research, define a taxonomy to describe Twitter use, and characterize the current state of Twitter in health research. Search methods. We performed a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and CINAHL through September 2015. Selection criteria. We searched for peer-reviewed original research studies that primarily used Twitter for health research. Data collection and analysis. Two authors independently screened studies and abstracted data related to the approach to analysis of Twitter data, methodology used to study Twitter, and current state of Twitter research by evaluating time of publication, research topic, discussion of ethical concerns, and study funding source. Main results. Of 1110 unique health-related articles mentioning Twitter, 137 met eligibility criteria. The primary approaches for using Twitter in health research that constitute a new taxonomy were content analysis (56%; n = 77), surveillance (26%; n = 36), engagement (14%; n = 19), recruitment (7%; n = 9), intervention (7%; n = 9), and network analysis (4%; n = 5). These studies collectively analyzed more than 5 billion tweets primarily by using the Twitter application program interface. Of 38 potential data features describing tweets and Twitter users, 23 were reported in fewer than 4% of the articles. The Twitter-based studies in this review focused on a small subset of data elements including content analysis, geotags, and language. Most studies were published recently (33% in 2015). Public health (23%; n = 31) and infectious disease (20%; n = 28) were the research fields most commonly represented in the included studies. Approximately one third of the studies mentioned ethical board approval in their articles. Primary funding sources included federal (63%), university (13%), and foundation (6%). Conclusions. We identified a new taxonomy to describe Twitter use in health research with 6 categories. Many data elements discernible from a user’s Twitter profile, especially demographics, have been underreported in the literature and can provide new opportunities to characterize the users whose data are analyzed in these studies. Twitter-based health research is a growing field funded by a diversity of organizations. Public health implications. Future work should develop standardized reporting guidelines for health researchers who use Twitter and policies that address privacy and ethical concerns in social media research.

Tweets formed into more aggregated patterns especially early in the study. Across networks, 35.00% (7 days after the quit date), 49.38% (30 days), and 46.88% (60 days) abstained from smoking. We demonstrated that abstainers and nonabstainers engaged with one another in dyads and small groups. This study preliminarily suggests potential for Twitter as a platform for adult smoking-cessation interventions.

To report on vaccine opposition and misinformation promoted on Twitter, highlighting Twitter accounts that drive conversation. Methods. We used supervised machine learning to code all Twitter posts. We first identified codes and themes manually by using a grounded theoretical approach and then applied them to the full data set algorithmically. We identified the top 50 authors month-over-month to determine influential sources of information related to vaccine opposition. Results. The data collection period was June 1 to December 1, 2019, resulting in 356 594 mentions of vaccine opposition. A total of 129 Twitter authors met the qualification of a top author in at least 1 month. Top authors were responsible for 59.5% of vaccine-opposition messages. We identified 10 conversation themes. Themes were similarly distributed across top authors and all other authors mentioning vaccine opposition. Top authors appeared to be highly coordinated in their promotion of misinformation within themes. Conclusions. Public health has struggled to respond to vaccine misinformation. Results indicate that sources of vaccine misinformation are not as heterogeneous or distributed as it may first appear given the volume of messages. There are identifiable upstream sources of misinformation, which may aid in countermessaging and public health surveillance.

Little is known about the use of social media as a tool for health communication. We used a mixed-methods design to examine communication about childhood obesity on Twitter. Methods. NodeXL was used to collect tweets sent in June 2013 containing the hashtag #childhoodobesity. Tweets were coded for content; tweeters were classified by sector and health focus. Data were also collected on the network of follower connections among the tweeters. We used descriptive statistics and exponential random graph modeling to examine tweet content, characteristics of tweeters, and the composition and structure of the network of connections facilitating communication among tweeters. Results. We collected 1110 tweets originating from 576 unique Twitter users. More individuals (65.6%) than organizations (32.9%) tweeted. More tweets focused on individual behavior than environment or policy. Few government and educational tweeters were in the network, but they were more likely than private individuals to be followed by others. Conclusions. There is an opportunity to better disseminate evidence-based information to a broad audience through Twitter by increasing the presence of credible sources in the #childhoodobesity conversation and focusing the content of tweets on scientific evidence.

To use publicly accessible data from people who post to Twitter to rapidly capture and describe the public's recent experiences with cannabis. Methods. We obtained Twitter posts containing cannabis-related terms from May 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018. We used methods to distinguish between posts from social bots and nonbots. We used text classifiers to identify topics in posts (n = 60 861). Results. Prevalent topics of posts included using cannabis with mentions of cannabis initiation, processed cannabis products, and health and medical with posts suggesting that cannabis could help with cancer, sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, trauma, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Polysubstance use was a common topic with mentions of cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, LSD, meth, mushrooms, and Xanax along with cannabis. Social bots regularly made health claims about cannabis. Conclusions. Findings suggest that processed cannabis products, unsubstantiated health claims about cannabis products, and the co-use of cannabis with legal and illicit substances warrant considerations by public health researchers in the future.

To provide a comprehensive workflow to identify top influential health misinformation about Zika on Twitter in 2016, reconstruct information dissemination networks of retweeting, contrast mis- from real information on various metrics, and investigate how Zika misinformation proliferated on social media during the Zika epidemic. Methods. We systematically reviewed the top 5000 English-language Zika tweets, established an evidence-based definition of ""misinformation,"" identified misinformation tweets, and matched a comparable group of real-information tweets. We developed an algorithm to reconstruct retweeting networks for 266 misinformation and 458 comparable real-information tweets. We computed and compared 9 network metrics characterizing network structure across various levels between the 2 groups. Results. There were statistically significant differences in all 9 network metrics between real and misinformation groups. Misinformation network structures were generally more sophisticated than those in the real-information group. There was substantial within-group variability, too. Conclusions. Dissemination networks of Zika misinformation differed substantially from real information on Twitter, indicating that misinformation utilized distinct dissemination mechanisms from real information. Our study will lead to a more holistic understanding of health misinformation challenges on social media.

It is increasingly clear that some of their activities can have a negative impact on public health. This guide provides an overview of the types of malicious actors currently active on Twitter by highlighting the characteristic behaviors and strategies employed. It covers both automated accounts (including traditional spambots, social spambots, content polluters, and fake followers) and human users (primarily trolls). It also addresses the unique threat of state-sponsored trolls. We utilize examples from our own research on vaccination to illustrate. The diversity of malicious actors and their multifarious goals adds complexity to research efforts that use Twitter. Bots are now part of the social media landscape, and although it may not be possible to stop their influence, it is vital that public health researchers and practitioners recognize the potential harms and develop strategies to address bot- and troll-driven messages.

In particular, Twitter ""infoveillance"" has demonstrated utility across health contexts. However, rigorous and reproducible methodologies for using Twitter data in public health are not yet well articulated, particularly those related to content analysis, which is a highly popular approach. In 2014, we gathered an interdisciplinary team of health science researchers, computer scientists, and methodologists to begin implementing an open-source framework for real-time infoveillance of Twitter health messages (RITHM). Through this process, we documented common challenges and novel solutions to inform future work in real-time Twitter data collection and subsequent human coding. The RITHM framework allows researchers and practitioners to use well-planned and reproducible processes in retrieving, storing, filtering, subsampling, and formatting data for health topics of interest. Further considerations for human coding of Twitter data include coder selection and training, data representation, codebook development and refinement, and monitoring coding accuracy and productivity. We illustrate methodological considerations through practical examples from formative work related to hookah tobacco smoking, and we reference essential methods literature related to understanding and using Twitter data.

We examined whether characteristics of local health departments (LHD) and their geographic region were associated with using Facebook and Twitter. We also examined the number of tweets per month for Twitter accounts as an indicator of social media use by LHDs. Methods. In 2012, we searched for Facebook and Twitter accounts for 2565 LHDs nationwide, and collected adoption date and number of connections for each account. Number of tweets sent indicated LHD use of social media. LHDs were classified as innovators, early adopters, or nonadopters. Characteristics of LHDs were compared across adoption categories, and we examined geographic characteristics, connections, and use. Results. Twenty-four percent of LHDs had Facebook, 8% had Twitter, and 7% had both. LHDs serving larger populations were more likely to be innovators, tweeted more often, and had more social media connections. Frequency of tweeting was not associated with adoption category. There were differences in adoption across geographic regions, with western states more likely to be innovators. Innovation was also higher in states where the state health department adopted social media. Conclusions. Social media has the potential to aid LHDs in disseminating information across the public health system. More evidence is needed to develop best practices for this emerging tool.

The Defibrillator Design Challenge was an online initiative that asked the public to create educational designs that would enhance AED visibility, which took place over 8 weeks, from February 6, 2014, to April 6, 2014. Participants were encouraged to vote for AED designs and share designs on social media for points. Using a mixed-methods study design, we measured participant demographics and motivations, design characteristics, dissemination, and Web site engagement. Results. Over 8 weeks, there were 13 992 unique Web site visitors; 119 submitted designs and 2140 voted. The designs were shared 48 254 times on Facebook and Twitter. Most designers–voters reported that they participated to contribute to an important cause (44%) rather than to win money (0.8%). Design themes included: empowerment, location awareness, objects (e.g., wings, lightning, batteries, lifebuoys), and others. Conclusions. The Defibrillator Design Challenge engaged a broad audience to generate AED designs and foster awareness.

We examined the use of low-cost social media platforms in communicating public health messages and outline the laugh model, a frame- work through which public health organizations can reach and engage communities. Methods. In August 2014, we developed an online campaign (Web site and social media) to help promote healthy family meals in Utah in conjunction with the state and local health departments. Results. By the end of September 2014, a total of 3641 individuals had visited the Utahfamilymeals.org Web site. Facebook ads reached a total of 29 078 people, and 56 900 people were reached through Twitter ads. The per-person price of the campaign was 0.2 cents, and the total estimated target population reach was between 10% and 12%. Conclusions. There are 3 key takeaways from our campaign: use of empowering and engaging techniques may be more effective than use of educational techniques; use of social media Web sites and online marketing tactics can enhance collaboration, interdisciplinary strategies, and campaign effectiveness; and use of social media as a communication platform is often preferable to use of mass media in terms of cost-effectiveness, more precise evaluations of campaign success, and increased sustainability.

A Study of Arizona's SB 1070 Using Twitter Data,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,10.1086/692983,,"Scholars have debated whether laws can influence public opinion, but evidence of these feedback effects is scant. This article examines the effect of Arizona's 2010 high-profile anti-immigrant law, SB 1070, on both public attitudes and behaviors toward immigrants. Using sentiment analysis and a difference-in-difference approach to analyze more than 250,000 tweets, the author finds that SB 1070 had a negative impact on the average sentiment of tweets regarding immigrants, Mexicans, and Hispanics, but not on those about Asians or blacks. However, these changes in public discourse were not caused by shifting attitudes toward immigrants but by the mobilization of anti-immigrant users and by motivating new users to begin tweeting. While some scholars propose that punitive laws can shape people's attitudes toward targeted groups, this study shows that policies are more likely to influence behaviors. Rather than placating the electorate, anti-immigrant laws may stir the pot further, mobilizing individuals already critical of immigrants.",POLITICS; POLICY,WOS,,,,,,,,

This empirically driven paper explores how individuals that self-identify as sociologists on Twitter use the popular micro-blogging social media site. A total of 152,977 tweets from Twitter profiles of 130 sociologists were collected and examined using qualitative media analysis. The potential use of Twitter allows the sociologist to become both the generator and interlocutor of dialogue with publics. We frame our data analysis and discussion around the core theme of expertise - namely, the role that expertise plays in the use of Twitter by sociologists. Our findings indicate that when sociologists used Twitter as sociologists (i.e., drawing upon their stated research expertise) little direct engagement with publics occurred. Thus, while sociologists appear to be using Twitter as a space for public sociology, the use of this interactive platform is mostly limited to the generation of content, a finding consistent with Burawoy's traditional form of public sociology. Suggestions for future research are noted.

We contrasted the dimensional and discrete theories of emotion by comparing tweets' virality as a function of their valence or discrete emotional content. While both perspectives were supported by the popularity of positive and joyful tweets, the unpopularity of negative and fearful tweets uniquely supported the discrete view. The robustness of this theoretically insightful finding was checked by applying a set of keywords from the Department of Homeland Security to identify tweets that were both negative and fear‐evoking. Iranian and Russian disinformation operatives seemed unaware of negative and fearful tweets' unpopularity and composed most posts with these sentiments.

Existing studies using mobile phone data revealed distinct and recurrent transitional activity patterns, known as mobility motifs, in people's daily lives. The limitation in using only a few inferred activity types hinders our ability to examine general patterns in detail. We proposed a mobility network approach with geographic context-aware Twitter data to investigate granular daily activity patterns in the urban environment. We first used publicly accessible geolocated tweets to track the movements of individuals in two major U.S. cities, Chicago and Greater Boston, where each recorded location is associated with its closest land use parcel to enrich its geographic context. A direct mobility network represents the daily location history of the selected active users, where the nodes are physical places with semantically labeled activity types and the edges represent the transitions. Analyzing the isomorphic structure of the mobility networks uncovered sixteen types of location-based motifs, which describe over 83 percent of the networks in both cities and are comparable to those from previous studies. With detailed and semantically labeled transitions between every two activities, we further dissected the general location-based motifs into activity-based motifs, where sixteen common activity-based motifs describe more than 57 percent of transitional behaviors in the daily activities in the two cities. The integration of geographic context from the synthesis of geolocated Twitter data with land use parcels enables us to reveal unique activity motifs that form the fundamental elements embedded in complex urban activities.

These responses and behaviors could be better understood by analyzing real-time social media data through categorizing them into the three phases of the emergency management: preparedness, response, and recovery. This study analyzes the spatial-temporal patterns of Twitter activities during Hurricane Sandy, which struck the U.S. Northeast on 29 October 2012. The study area includes 126 counties affected by Hurricane Sandy. The objectives are threefold: (1) to derive a set of common indexes from Twitter data so that they can be used for emergency management and resilience analysis; (2) to examine whether there are significant geographical and social disparities in disaster-related Twitter use; and (3) to test whether Twitter data can improve postdisaster damage estimation. Three corresponding hypotheses were tested. Results show that common indexes derived from Twitter data, including ratio, normalized ratio, and sentiment, could enable comparison across regions and events and should be documented. Social and geographical disparities in Twitter use existed in the Hurricane Sandy event, with higher disaster-related Twitter use communities generally being communities of higher socioeconomic status. Finally, adding Twitter indexes into a damage estimation model improved the adjusted R2 from 0.46 to 0.56, indicating that social media data could help improve postdisaster damage estimation, but other environmental and socioeconomic variables influencing the capacity to reducing damage might need to be included. The knowledge gained from this study could provide valuable insights into strategies for utilizing social media data to increase resilience to disasters.

Geographical information systems and visualization techniques underlie the methodology of this study. Findings show that the geography of information sharing in social media about a missing person is not random, revealing a globally dispersed pattern across the country. Information sharing contains more emotional than informational content, hitting a peak of spread after a person is found deceased. This finding indicates that the value of information shared by social media as a problem-solving resource might have so far been overestimated in the process of finding missing persons.

There is a lack of systematic examination of the representativeness of LBSM data, though. If LBSM data are applied to decision making in smart city services, such as emergency response or transportation, it is essential to understand their limitations to implement better policies or management practices. This study formalizes the sampling biases of LBSM data from various perspectives, including sociodemographic, spatiotemporal, and semantic.

To reduce fatalities and economic losses, coastal states and counties take protective actions, including sheltering in place and evacuation away from the coast. Not everyone adheres to hurricane evacuation warnings or orders. In reality, evacuation rates are far less than 100 percent and are estimated using posthurricane questionnaire surveys to residents in the affected area. To overcome limitations of traditional data collection methods that are costly in time and resources, an increasing number of natural hazards studies have used social media data as a data source. To better understand social media users' evacuation behaviors, this article investigates whether activity space, social network, and long-term sentiment trends are associated with individuals' evacuation decisions by measuring and comparing Twitter users' evacuation decisions during Hurricane Matthew in 2016. We find that (1) evacuated people have larger long-term activity spaces than nonevacuated people, (2) people in the same social network tend to make the same evacuation decision, and (3) evacuated people have smaller long-term sentimental variances than nonevacuated people. These results are consistent with previous studies based on questionnaire and survey data and thus provide researchers a new method to study human behavior during disasters.

For example, showing where people are tweeting during a disaster might be interesting, but visually identifying where normal signals are missing could in fact highlight the most affected places. Parcel data might be fully present, but attributes of their observations could convey qualities of absence (e.g., abandoned structures). Current geovisualization approaches normally do not show anything at all when data are missing or contain qualities of absence and only in rare cases might use a specific hue to highlight the presence of absence on maps. This work argues that people perceive missingness and absence in a way that is distinct from other spatial data qualities, and we propose a typology of static and dynamic means by which we can draw user attention to the presence of absence. To explore the application of these techniques, I use urban parcel data to visualize patterns of property blight in a Detroit neighborhood. Based on conceptual development and case study application, I propose research challenges to evaluate visual representations of missing and absent information on maps.

We found important differences in how these agendas unfolded: Environmental events were more likely to be concrete actions, whereas racist events were more likely to involve ""noisy"" rhetoric. The differing forms are not associated with particular levels of harm; rather, they suggest the unanticipated and complex ways in which racism intersects with environmental governance under neoliberal, authoritarian regimes. We argue that Trump's ""spectacular racism,"" characterized by sensational visibility, helps obscure the profound deregulation underway. The white nation plays a critical role, as Trump uses spectacular racism to nurture his base, consolidate his power, and implement his agenda.

Our objective is to determine the representative spatiotemporal trajectories of individuals, accounting for stochastic disturbances and spatiotemporal variability, but using activity data with longer duration. Therefore, we explore using Twitter data, which have relatively low and irregular spatial and temporal resolutions. This article introduces a methodology to construct individual representative space–time paths using various aggregation and spatiotemporal clustering techniques. To depict and visualize spatiotemporal trajectories with uncertain information, we propose space–time cones of variable sizes to reflect the spatial precision of the paths and use colors on the cones to represent the confidence level. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we use the geo-tagged tweets for an extended period. Our analysis indicates that the representative space–time path reasonably describes an individual's regular activity patterns. As visual elements, cones and cone colors effectively show the varying geographical precision along the path and changing certainty levels across different path segments, respectively.

A K means clustering algorithm was then applied to create clusters of nodes with similar characteristics and eWOM content within each cluster was analysed using automated content analysis. The resulting model indicates that destination and event eWOM maintains a macro network structure in which a small number of accounts or hubs influence information sharing.

Exploring the relation between what they referred to as 'the spatial and statist orders,' they argued that conceptualizations of the nature of the state have not attended adequately to the ways in which states are spatialized and endeavored to show, through ethnography, how people come to experience the state as an entity with certain spatial characteristics and properties. Building on these ideas, but also moving beyond their taken-for-granted assumptions about the state's spatiality, this essay makes use of one ethnographic case example in an effort to offer a fine-grained illustration of the spatial dimensions of the project of state securitization in the urban landscape. I do this by looking closely at the field of urban mobility in Beirut, Lebanon, and the Twitter account for the city's Traffic Management Center, launched in late 2013 by the Ministry of Interior. Through my analysis of the spatial modes of statecraft that are produced through this Twitter account, I develop an argument about how the social media technology of Twitter serves as a portal through which to view how the state secures its legitimacy and naturalizes its authority in both virtual and physical space, while, at the same time, this technology - if only fleetingly - can be harnessed to issue challenges to this legitimacy and authority. What is at stake in the Traffic Management Center's Twitter account, I suggest, is the production of the state as an entity that is not just powerful in the sense of being vertical to society and encompassing of urban space, but the very idea that the state offers security and protection to its citizens.

This paper shows how the protesters' use of citizen rage, anger and emotion was criminalised, pathologised and (de)politicised by certain Zimbabwean newspapers, including the Herald and the Chronicle, as well as the Daily News. In this manner these media outlets became complicit in (de)naturalising and constructing what can be referred to as ""normative Zimbabweanness."" Using an autoethnographical perspective, the paper employs a critical diversity literacy reading of texts on the protests in three online newspapers. It examines how these accounts sought to police protester rage, anger and emotion by prescribing ""legitimate"" forms of protest compatible with the idea of a more acceptable state-sanctioned Zimbabwean identity — what this paper calls a normative Zimbabweanness. The article argues that the protests symbolise resistance against ZANU-PF's prescribed normative Zimbabweanness, a resistance that offers an alternative way of understanding citizen protest action in the postcolonial Zimbabwean context.

It recently became the subject of some controversy after a scientist revealed that 10 out of the 12 British water companies stated on Twitter that they used the practice, despite a lack of scientific evidence for its efficacy. In this article, the author analyzes the contours of this controversy in order to identify underlying cultural attitudes towards knowledge and the landscape it reveals. He concludes by sounding two notes of caution regarding the critical posture adopted by scientists who are rushing to condemn this customary practice, stressing the importance of understanding the nature of dowsing as a cultural form regardless of its efficacy and the need for scientists to be mindful of their own biases and preconceptions.

The story acted as a kind of 'accidental Olympics', evoking national sentiment and global communitas, and offering more than a billion people the chance to peek into the lives of the miners and their families. But responses to the rescue were not the same everywhere. This article examines responses in Mexico. Whereas elsewhere the story's appeal lay in its capacity to be presented as a 'politics-free zone', this seemed to be less the case in Mexico. Some Mexican publics, at least, were relatively immune to the apolitical 'inspiration' offered by the media and enthusiastically taken up elsewhere. This is because many Mexicans see a painful contrast between circumstances in their country and those in Chile. This sense of contrast manifested itself not only in a lower degree of 'buy-in' to the feel-good aspect of the story in Mexico, but also in a surge of ill-feeling and protest against the Mexican government, and in a telling spate of jokes that did the rounds in October and November, which were disseminated on Twitter and YouTube and reported in television and print media. The jokes followed the formula: 'If the [Chilean] miners had been Mexican...' and drew on strains of social and political satire with a long history in Mexico.

The rise in usage of social networks offers users a new medium in which they can broadcast their preferences and activities, including about animals. In two studies, the first on Facebook status updates and the second on images shared on Twitter, we revisited the link between Big Five personality traits and animal preference, specifically focusing on cats and dogs. We used automatic content analysis of text and images to unobtrusively measure preference for animals online using large datasets. In study 1, a dataset of Facebook status updates (n = 72,559) were analyzed and it was found that those who mentioned ownership of a cat (by using the phrase ""my cat"" (n = 5,053)) in their status updates were more open to experience, introverted, neurotic, and less conscientious when compared with the general population. Users mentioning ownership of a dog (by using ""my dog"" (n = 8,045)) were only less conscientious compared with the rest of the population. In study 2, a dataset of Twitter images was analyzed and revealed that users who featured either cat (n = 1,036) or dog (n = 1,499) images in their tweets were more neurotic, less conscientious, and less agreeable than those who did not. In addition, posting images containing cats was specific to users higher in openness, while posting images featuring dogs was associated with users higher in extraversion. These findings taken together align with some previous findings on the relationship between owner personality and animal preference, additionally highlighting some social media-specific behaviors.",Twitter; FACEBOOK; social media; Facebook; Big Five; cat people; CAT PEOPLE; COMPANIONS; dog people; DOG PEOPLE; PET OWNERSHIP; TRAITS,WOS,,,,,,,,

It examines the level of social media adoption by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in protecting Filipino nationals abroad. The popularity of social networking sites among Filipinos, including DFA officials and staff, played a vital role in influencing the institution's move toward social media adoption. Key informant interviews were conducted with 10 officials, case officers, and staff at the DFA home office and Foreign Service Posts in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from June to July 2019. While Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can be effective tools for speedy communication between the DFA and OFWs, the DFA faces several challenges such as budgetary constraints, lack of human resources with ICT skills, and verifying reports, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the indispensable role of social media platforms in communicating with OFWs and in extending assistance to those in distress. Hence, the DFA may consider the formulation of an agency-wide social media strategy and collaboration with other migration authorities on social media-anchored projects.

Given the ideological connotations in the construct of people's concerns about economic inequality, whether those who live in more unequal countries are more interested in economic inequality remains unclear. In this research, we aimed to examine whether objective economic inequality is related to individuals' interest in the topic of economic inequality. First, we used data from the United States Census Bureau and Google Trends to examine whether the objective level of economic inequality predicted the interest of the population in searching Google for terms such as ""economic inequality"" and ""income inequality."" Our results showed that individuals who live in more economically unequal U.S. states more often search these terms. Second, we analysed the tweets that contained the terms ""economic inequality"" and ""income inequality"" (10,118 tweets) published over 9 days and localised by U.S. state. We found that individuals who live in more economically unequal U.S. states more often post tweets about economic and income inequality. To take a closer look at the narrative around economic/income inequality, we conducted a network analysis using tweets as nodes and retweets as edges. Our results suggest that the public narrative about economic inequality via Twitter was built on three large communities. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in relation to economic inequality consequences.

First, to what extent is awe a relevant emotion in consumer experiences of products? A pilot study examined contents of tweets containing ""awe"" and showed that it was frequently used in people's voluntary expressions. Study 1 showed that products could elicit awe among a significant portion of consumers. Second, what kind of product triggers awe in consumers? Study 2 determined that descriptions of awe-inspiring products typically featured four dimensions: timelessness, accommodation, beauty, and vastness. Studies 3 and 4 showed that only timelessness and accommodation could differentiate awe from admiration (Study 3) and love (Study 4) whereas beauty and vastness were not as important. The third question relates to the consequences produced by awe-inspiring products. Study 3 showed that awe comprised a blend of positive and negative emotions. Studies 3 to 5 showed that awe not only made products more memorable but also enhanced consumers' intentions to spread positive word-of-mouth publicity and to purchase the product. These findings shed light on the folk understanding and expression of this emotion and establish key landmarks in the hitherto uncharted consumer research domain of awe.

To further understand the advertising practices during this period, we aimed to determine whether packaged liquor retailers increased their posts during COVID‐19 or used COVID‐19 to promote alcohol on Twitter. Methods: 'Tweets' (Twitter posts) from all packaged liquor retailers in NSW written since 2018 were collected. Tweets written during the first COVID‐19 lockdown period were coded for: references of COVID‐19, types of marketing message, use of links to online stores and use of an alcohol‐related 'meme'. Results: There was no evidence of increased tweet frequency, however, some COVID‐specific alcohol advertising was detected that leveraged the pandemic (4.0%) or referencing the pandemic without explicitly promoting alcohol (12.0%). The most popular market messages used in the tweets were encouraging alcohol use (15.4%) and easy access to alcohol at home (9.5%). Conclusions: At least on Twitter, there was no marked increase in posts from packaged liquor retailers in NSW and only some tweets used COVID‐19 to promote alcohol.

This article explores this process. First, it conceptualises populist politicisation of foreign policy. Second, it develops expectations on how such politicisation will take place: the distinctive features of populism (the intensity of populist discourse, the relative weight of anti-elitism and people-centrism, and a transnational understanding of the 'people' or the 'elite') will have an impact on how foreign policy is politicised. The empirical analysis focuses on selected public speeches and tweets by two populist leaders from the Global South: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Narendra Modi. The analysis reveals huge differences: the more populist Erdoğan emphasises anti-elitism and extensively resorts to the politicisation of Turkish foreign policy by constructing foreign threats. Modi is less populist and his discourse emphasises people-centrism; as expected, he only marginally politicises foreign policy, highlighting the greatness of the Indian nation.

Based on a conceptualisation of authenticity as discursive performance, we conduct a comparative analysis of the authenticity claims of two right-wing populist leaders, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. We focus on authenticity claims associated with international politics. International issues are central to populist exclusionary narratives, but also difficult for populist incumbents to narrate authentically. We find that despite differences in their public personas, Johnson and Trump show considerable similarities in both content and style of their authenticity performances. In particular, they 'domesticate' international politics to reinforce domestic issues assumed closer to 'ordinary' voters, all the while employing rhetorical styles suggestive of their authenticity. These findings highlight the centrality of authenticity performances to populist politics and electoral appeal.

However, when they do, they are also faced with gendered criticisms 'hashtag feminism' that may instead serve to silence them. Based on social identity theory, this research examined how women's social media activism, in response to sexism, may be a first step towards further activism. Two studies used a simulated Twitter paradigm to expose women to sexism and randomly assign them to either tweet in response, or to a no‐tweet control condition. Both studies found support for a serial mediation model such that tweeting out after sexism strengthened social identity, which in turn increased collective action intentions, and in turn, behavioural collective actions. Study 2 further showed that validation from others increases the indirect effect of tweeting on behavioural collective action through collective action intentions, but group efficacy did not moderate any indirect effects. It was concluded that social media activism in response to sexism promotes an enactment of women's social identity, thereby mobilizing them to further action.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged‐group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged‐group 'allies'. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged‐group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.

This study explores the role played by 'appeals to nature' in the referendum debate. Little research has investigated how biological attributions are spontaneously generated in real-world discourse regarding sexual rights. Through content analysis of newspaper and Twitter discussion of the referendum, this study aims to (1) establish the frequency of appeals to nature and their distribution across the various 'sides' of the debate and (2) analyse the forms these natural claims took and the rhetorical functions they fulfilled. Appeals to nature occurred in a minority of media discussion of the referendum (13.6% of newspaper articles and .3% of tweets). They were more prominent in material produced by anti-marriage equality commentators. Biological attributions predominantly occurred in relation to parenthood, traditional marriage, gender, and homosexuality. The article analyses the rhetorical dynamics of these natural claims and considers the implications for marriage equality research and activism. The analysis suggests appeals to nature allow anti-marriage equality discourse adapt to a cultural context that proscribes outright disapproval of same-sex relationships. However, it also queries whether previous research has overemphasized the significance of biological attributions in discourse about groups' rights.

The study applies a critical discursive psychological approach to study these discursive patterns in two interrelated social media datasets, comprising discussion threads from Facebook and Twitter. The study shows how, through argumentation and dialogue, the commenters' position both each other and the female populist leader as fit or unfit, racist or non‐racist, patriotic or non‐patriotic and as a victim or culprit of hate‐speech and misogyny. The implications of these findings for social psychological research on radical‐right populism, political polarization and online hate‐speech are discussed.

In March 2019, female Muslim MP Leila Ali Elmi argued publicly for introducing equality data in Sweden, in opposition to prevailing colour‐blind and antiracialist norms. Her statement was controversially formulated in terms of 'registering' people 'by race', leading to forceful criticism in the mainstream press and on social media, particularly on Twitter. In a material representing this criticism, we analyse discourse participants' argumentative strategies, focusing on mobilisations of race and racism as acts of subject positioning, performative of a moral identity. Participants positioned themselves as morally righteous, liberal antiracists by virtue of their own antiracialism (Goldberg, 2009, The threat of race. Wiley‐Blackwell, Hoboken, NJ) and colour‐blindness (Bonilla‐Silva, 2010, Racism without racists. Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham, MA), while constructing equality data as a racist practice, and as a threat to a liberal order. They also constructed advocates of equality data, and specifically Ali Elmi herself, as being irrational race ideologues, to be morally condemned for espousing a return to racial thinking comparable to that of German Nazism or scientific racism. The findings point to the exceptional status and character of what we call a colour‐blind antiracialism in Sweden, and further show how far 'liberal arguments for illiberal ends' can go in reinforcing a moral status quo and counteracting antiracist reform.

Yet the psychological and behavioral consequences of advocacy have rarely been considered. Across 3 experiments (combined N = 934) in the contexts of debates around racial discrimination and abortion, we investigated if and how exposure to advocacy can influence collective giving responses: self‐reported willingness to make donations congruent with one's beliefs on the issue and actual giving behavior. Reading tweets from one's own side of a contentious debate sometimes indirectly mobilized collective giving responses by enhancing perceptions of efficacy and ensuring people empathized and identified with highlighted victim groups. Simultaneously, however, supporting advocacy sometimes inadvertently suppressed action by reducing anger and perceived injustice. Results therefore show that advocacy can simultaneously mobilize and demobilize support. However, effects were not found consistently across contexts and donation measures. Overall, mobilization pathways were stronger, especially on donation behavior and in the context of the abortion debate. Results suggest advocacy can work broadly as intended: by influencing the attitudes and behaviors of audience members. Online advocacy exposure in social media echo chambers may therefore be contributing to political polarization. Finally, results also demonstrate that charitable giving can be a form of collective action.

The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television, radio, youth conferences, and text messaging campaigns, interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged. Objectives: This review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate. Search Methods: We systematically searched 2 database aggregators, 36 individual databases, 6 individual journals, and 34 websites, as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature, and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature. Inclusion Criteria: We included randomized and rigorous quasi‐experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10–17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background, religious affiliation, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, or citizenship status. Data Collection and Analysis: The systematic search covered January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2020, with searches conducted between August 19, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24, 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention, sample, outcomes, and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta‐analysis on two independent effect sizes. Main Results: Two studies were included in the meta‐analysis, one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta‐analysis we chose the treatment arm from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study. However, we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects, while the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = −0.134, 95% confidence interval [−0.321, −0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as ""low risk"" on the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study as ""some"" risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and ""high risk"" for selective outcome reporting bias. The Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as ""some concern"" for the selective outcome reporting bias domain. Authors' Conclusions: The evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi‐experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions, addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software, and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including both extremist and non‐extremist individuals in future intervention studies. We provide suggestions for how future research on online hate speech/cyberhate interventions can fill these gaps moving forward.

Stakeholders are any individual or group who is responsible for or affected by health‐ and healthcare‐related decisions. This includes patients, the public, providers of health care and policymakers for example. As part of the guidance development process, Multi‐Stakeholder Engagement (MuSE) Consortium set out to conduct four concurrent systematic reviews to summarise the evidence on: (1) existing guidance for stakeholder engagement in guideline development, (2) barriers and facilitators to stakeholder engagement in guideline development, (3) managing conflicts of interest in stakeholder engagement in guideline development and (4) measuring the impact of stakeholder engagement in guideline development. This protocol addresses the second systematic review in the series. Objectives: The objective of this review is to identify and synthesise the existing evidence on barriers and facilitators to stakeholder engagement in health guideline development. We will address this objective through two research questions: (1) What are the barriers to multi‐stakeholder engagement in health guideline development across any of the 18 steps of the GIN‐McMaster checklist? (2) What are the facilitators to multi‐stakeholder engagement in health guideline development across any of the 18 steps of the GIN‐McMaster checklist? Search Methods: A comprehensive search strategy will be developed and peer‐reviewed in consultation with a medical librarian. We will search the following databases: MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Sociological Abstracts. To identify grey literature, we will search the websites of agencies who actively engage stakeholder groups such as the AHRQ, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Strategy for Patient‐Oriented Research (SPOR), INVOLVE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the PCORI. We will also search the websites of guideline‐producing agencies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, Australia's National Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the WHO. We will invite members of the team to suggest grey literature sources and we plan to broaden the search by soliciting suggestions via social media, such as Twitter. Selection Criteria: We will include empirical qualitative and mixed‐method primary research studies which qualitatively report on the barriers or facilitators to stakeholder engagement in health guideline development. The population of interest is stakeholders in health guideline development. Building on previous work, we have identified 13 types of stakeholders whose input can enhance the relevance and uptake of guidelines: Patients, caregivers and patient advocates; Public; Providers of health care; Payers of health services; Payers of research; Policy makers; Program managers; Product makers; Purchasers; Principal investigators and their research teams; and Peer‐review editors/publishers. Eligible studies must describe stakeholder engagement at any of the following steps of the GIN‐McMaster Checklist for Guideline Development. Data Collection and Analysis: All identified citations from electronic databases will be imported into Covidence software for screening and selection. Documents identified through our grey literature search will be managed and screened using an Excel spreadsheet. A two‐part study selection process will be used for all identified citations: (1) a title and abstract review and (2) full‐text review. At each stage, teams of two review authors will independently assess all potential studies in duplicate using a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data will be extracted by two review authors independently and in duplicate according to a standardised data extraction form. Main Results: The results of this review will be used to inform the development of guidance for multi‐stakeholder engagement in guideline development and implementation. This guidance will be official GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Working Group guidance. The GRADE system is internationally recognised as a standard for guideline development. The findings of this review will assist organisations who develop healthcare, public health and health policy guidelines, such as the World Health Organization, to involve multiple stakeholders in the guideline development process to ensure the development of relevant, high quality and transparent guidelines.

The 1992 protests in Los Angeles following the death of Rodney King are one example of public response to an instance of excessive use of force. More recently, the death of George Floyd led to widespread protests against excessive use of force and the current model of policing in general. The increasing popularity and availability of social media over the past decade have made it a powerful tool for mobilizing citizens and provided a place for protest. This study looks at the negative reactions of social media users to police use of force in the United States based on analysis of two significant instances: the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. Using quantitative, forensic linguistics, and advanced topic modelling methodologies, three prominent aspects of policing identified in the literature – excessive use of force, racial bias, and legitimacy – were analysed from 14 days of tweets following each event. Analyses deal with trends in frequency, case similarities, and topic modelling. The results show important differences in negative online reaction to the two events, particularly regarding excessive use of force: those following the Floyd death focused on the technicalities of the intervention, while those responding to the Blake death focused on its aftermath. Analysis of tweets related to racial bias and police legitimacy revealed similar patterns, with users repeating criticisms such as differential treatment according to race and the need for changes in the policing model. The results also suggest that perceptions of excessive use of force and racial bias are deeply intertwined. Implications and issues are discussed.

Unfortunately, in-person social support may be difficult to obtain because of stigma. CAPs may instead turn to online forums for people who are sexually attracted to children. The present study looks at the emotional, informational, and tangible support CAPs offered and received through online forums. We recruited 353 CAPs from Twitter and multiple online forums. The survey covered basic demographics, frequency of forum use, reasons for forum use, social support received or offered, helpfulness of forums, and their quality of offline support. Most CAPs said that they initially sought out forums to avoid feeling alone in their attraction; the quality of offline support was rated as moderate. Emotional support and informational support were the most frequently endorsed forms of social support. CAPs who visited more forums reported forums to be less helpful, which could reflect ""forum shopping."" A Poisson regression predicting online support from quality of offline support and various demographic and forum use variables did not reveal any significant results. This is the first quantitative study to look at the benefits of forums for CAPs regarding specific types of social support. The authors consider if certain forums, in addition to professional help, could be part of a repertoire of resources for CAPs who may be struggling.

Through a systematic examination of journalists' tweets during two key trials (Ghomeshi and Saretzky), we ask to what extent can the live-tweeting of court proceedings achieve greater access to justice in Canada? We argue that while the live-tweeting does provide more access to court, potentially furthering the principle of open court, the nature of this access provides little in the way of increased engagement with the public and its understanding of the legal system.

This is accomplished through the analysis of interview and observational data collected as part of a research project exploring UCS services at five Canadian universities and an examination of how UCS services at 14 Canadian universities communicate using the social media service Twitter. These UCS services were found to primarily use Twitter for the purposes of soliciting or requesting information and for networking. In communicating through Twitter, UCS services engage in public legitimation work in which they make claims about and attempt to demonstrate their expertise, authority, and accountability. This article argues that both UCS services’ particular legitimacy problem (i.e., their possession of both private and public attributes) and the interactive nature of public legitimation work create tensions that may serve to disrupt UCS services’ ability to attain legitimacy.

Together, these women have served as an aspirational tableau for other Russian women trying to navigate their own roles of mothers and businesswomen. This article examines how these ""czarinas"" have constructed their perceived social media identities as wives and mothers to create a relationship with their followers that allows the czarinas to influence their purchasing decisions.

Analyses of the tweets are conducted through both critical rhetoric and microaggressive theories, useful tools for exposing problematic hegemonic social practices regarding race, gender, and body politics within the music industry. This cultural critique on the role of celebrity feminists unmasks the role of discourse – intentional and unintentional – in both reproducing and challenging hegemonic ideologies; exposes Swift's unknowing contribution to neoliberal feminism; and positions Twitter as a valuable venue for emerging feminists to create counter-narratives that challenge formations within celebrity feminism. By examining the celebrities' digital interactions and the responsive fan intervention, we are able to come to a clearer understanding of the gestures that both support and challenge the co-constitutive structures of celebrity and feminism and see specifically the ways in which Swift's neoliberal form of feminism reinscribes the very oppression that she and other celebrity feminists claim to be against.

In this article I theorise 'aca-fandom' in relation to race, situating myself as a white feminist researcher/consumer of Black women's cultural and intellectual production. I reflect upon on my own use of Twitter in relation to Beyoncé's star image in order to explicate ways of engaging with celebrity beyond the authenticity paradigm centring on a front-stage/back-stage dichotomy. By following prominent social justice activists and writers who comprise 'Black Twitter', I was able to access their commentary on Lemonade in ways that enriched my understanding of Beyoncé's work; work that I increasingly felt distanced from, but more enthralled by. This article uses autoethnographic methods to re-centre the researcher body and illuminate connections between privilege and perspective on both star–audience relations and subject–researcher positions. Although Twitter may not challenge the hierarchical structures of media production, nor necessarily provide more 'authentic' views on celebrity, it does provide access to diverse perspectives on celebrity texts and, in this way, is a valuable resource for both audiences and researchers of celebrity culture.

Some authors make regular use of Twitter to post updates about professional activities, comments on events in their everyday lives, news of readings, statements of opinions, photos, links, or retweets. This study examines tweets by 10 authors, using corpus linguistic tools to find stylistic patterns characteristic of the corpus as a whole or of individual authors. The article then looks at tweets by others that mention the authors or use quotations from the authors in new contexts, creating an online presence for authors whether they tweet themselves or not. Authors are subject to the same tension between ordinariness and specialness that others have noted with stars in music, television, film, or fashion. Literature, because of its assumed cultural position, and its production in private, has sometimes been seen as being apart from and opposed to the cultural system of celebrity and promotion. But this cultural position also means the ordinariness of authors is treated as surprising and interesting, while the specialness makes them available to all as oracles.

Yet scholars are conflicted on whether Twitter’s expanded interaction is actual or merely perceived. Some contend that the social media site represents a democratised public square in which the borders between ordinary and extraordinary are flattened, while others argue that Twitter encompasses synthetic personalisation: hierarchical power dynamics masked by simulated interconnection. Assuming that Twitter communication is an extension of traditions of letter-writing by fans and fan clubs, this study utilises a framework for rhetorical arrangement drawn from medieval work on thears dictaminis, or the art of letter-writing. Informed by Cicero, thears dictaminisdivided the letter into five parts, includingexordium(opening),captatio benevolentiae(capturing of goodwill),narratio(background),petitio(petition/request), andconclusio(conclusion). Tweets directed at the top five most-followed Twitter accounts (Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Barack Obama, Rihanna, and Taylor Swift) are classified by which of thears dictaminiselements they accomplish. The findings suggest that, given the limitations of the medium, Twitter users focus oncaptatio benevolentiaeandpetitioin addressing stars. It is particularly startling that users often construct their Twitter handles as a reference to the star, thereby soliciting goodwill in the rhetorical space of message sender rather than content. The apparent emphasis oncaptatio benevolentiae– or facework – suggests a maintenance of hierarchical borders among Twitter addressers and addressees in line with synthetic personalisation. Implications are discussed for the future study of the rhetoric of fandom and parasocial interaction online.

Given the many questions surrounding the legitimacy of Jenner's transgender advocacy and her intentional use of Twitter as a medium to discuss transgender politics, this research conducted a textual analysis of Jenner's Twitter account, @Caitlyn_Jenner to examine how the transgender celebrity used social media to discuss her lived experiences as a transgender woman and advocate on behalf of the transgender community. The findings supported prior scholarly criticisms of Jenner's celebrity image, online celebrity activism, and transwomen's representations in celebrity culture. @Caitlyn_Jenner fostered online social connections and discussions with her transgender followers.

It shows how using constructs of the celebrity interview enables celebrities to articulate what it means to be an individual and a consumer within capitalist democracies. A discourse analysis of pertinent examples from leading Twitter celebrities demonstrates how these interactions are influenced by both thematic and linguistic patterns developed in celebrity interviews and how they now also occupy the space long held by the interview as a promotional performance.

Seven crime authors were chosen as a case sample, each of which published their first work after 2010 and might therefore be regarded as ‘social media natives’. The authors’ followers were categorised according to their self-descriptions into various professional and non-professional groups (e.g. ‘publishing industry professionals’, ‘fellow crime authors’). In some of these groups, notably ‘aspiring authors’ and ‘book fans/bloggers’, the performance of fandom was not always found to be uni-directional. Microanalysis of authors’ interactions with followers suggested that traditional media audience categories such as ‘fan’ have become looser in social media where all users are ‘followers’ and perform multiple identities. In particular, book bloggers seem to have carved out an important role as legitimising agents within the crime fiction field.

This wavering response to celebrity – a double-facing mode of celebrity performance in which the celebrity is disinclined to perform, yet performs nevertheless – reveals the privilege that constitutes such positioning. After all, to occupy a position of reluctance or hesitance is to have the privilege to be reluctant. Approaching celebrity as a space of fluid negotiations, we examine celebrities' first tweets on, and commentaries about, Twitter, as a means by which to demonstrate how celebrities negotiate their degree of reluctance to engage with the fields of power at play in social media interactions. In the second half of the paper, we argue that such positioning needs to be read alongside its celebrity social media 'other': the enthusiastic, entrepreneurial adoption of social media, best exemplified by the Kardashian family and their manifold social media endeavours. In their self-characterisation as social-media-made celebrities and external characterisations of them as the de facto media sell-outs, the Kardashians, as unreluctant celebrities, become the exceptions that prove the rule, inversely defining the privileged, reluctant expressions of more 'accepted' stars.

This article argues that while Twitter may represent a deviation from older models of stardom, there remain important continuities and contexts between ‘old’ and ‘new’ celebrity behaviours and media forms. It argues that Twitter exposes, rather than creates, the multiple ways in which stardom and celebrity status can exist and be analysed, and that many online practices characterised as new have clear antecedents in wider histories of stardom. It suggests that much of the value of exploring celebrity Twitter accounts lies in how the site, its usage and its content, renders historical negotiations around the construction and presentation of stardom visible. In order to do this, it draws upon a range of examples –with a particular focus on the Twitter account of John Cusack – examining how the management of online behaviour and identity illustrates significant debates around the subject of authenticity within celebrity culture.

Somerhalder’s youth engagement, in particular via Twitter, is explored. The paper considers the balance of marketing-led versus values-led communication strategies therein (which can be understood to promote smaller behaviour changes versus broader vision changes respectively) (Bortree 2012), and the potential influence of Somerhalder on mobilising participatory environmental action, politics and consciousness amongst his youthful fan demographic. The paper takes a critically optimist view of Somerhalder’s co-created ‘green vampire’ celebrity–fan articulations, and their collaborative potential to perform material ethics, that is, to effect change with and amongst his young fans.

In the convergent TV era, reality producers increasingly require that stars post-personal content on social media, blogs, and online video sites. Rather than hire transmedia content creators, television networks incentivise stars to generate their own digital texts by placing them in competition with their co-stars for attention, status, and salary. This new industry strategy seeks to cut costs while extending viewer engagement. In the reality TV emotion economy, where the most effective path to fame involves dramatic self-disclosure, stars are representing the hyperbolic performance of misery, jealousy, and resentment online. Just as reality producers rely on participants’ performance of the ‘money shot’ - a televised moment of emotional upheaval - the convergent TV industry requires a ‘digital money shot’ - an online performance of dramatic emotions that drives transmedia engagement. To begin mapping the contours of the ‘digital money shot’, this article examines the multi-platform world of Bravo’s reality docu-soap franchise, The Real Housewives, and the prevalence of the Twitter war, a social media feud used to draw viewers to new media sites. This practice illustrates how performative emotions and self-disclosure form the basis of Bravo’s transmedia strategy for The Real Housewives franchise.

The hashtag was first used on the social media platform Twitter to call attention to the injustice of the situation. Many celebrities have taken up the hashtag and used their own social media accounts to draw attention to the movement. This is different from past forms of celebrity activism in that it seeks to change power structures within society. William Howell and Trevor Parry-Giles have demonstrated how celebrity activists have the power to destabilise police authority. Their power as celebrities translates to a perceived authority of their own with an ability to reach large audiences. In this article, we use qualitative textual analysis to identify dominant themes in black celebrity tweets about #BLM and racial justice issues. We analyse how black celebrities use Twitter to promote #BLM and what impact they have in promoting and defining the #BlackLivesMatter movement. By analysing the Twitter feeds of celebrities such as Jesse Williams, Spike Lee, Janelle Monáe, and others, this article attempts to distinguish the qualitative impact of celebrity involvement in #BlackLivesMatter.

Regarded as a PR coup, particularly in the context of the ongoing Indian parliamentary elections, the 'freewheeling' interview underlined Bollywood's increasing proximity with the Modi-led BJP government. Employing a detailed analysis of the interview and the subsequent controversy, I examine the Bollywood star's role in disseminating political rhetoric, underlining in the process both shifts in discourses of Hindi film stardom, as well as the increasing politicisation of the new media ecology. In doing so, I also highlight the long-standing relationship and presence of Hindi film stars in the political arena, a fact that has received scant scholarly attention. As social networking sites like Twitter are inundated with selfies of Bollywood stars with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and hashtags like #CelebritieswithNamo and #ModiWithAkshay, it is imperative to analyse this emergent confluence of the political and the popular. Thus, using the Akshay Kumar–Narendra Modi interview as a case study, I examine not only the relationship between Hindi film stars and politics but also, the role of social media in shaping the current dynamics.

Using insights from imagology, we argue, firstly, that Wilders' use of national images allows him to align himself with the traditional narrative of Dutch collective resistance to foreign rule and thus to authenticate his political attitude as compliant with that of the Dutch national character. Secondly, turning to the field of celebrity studies, we demonstrate that this self-stylisation also involves a form of emotional work. In speeches, texts, campaign advertisements, and tweets, Wilders projects an affectively charged public self that 'moves' the audience and lends a sense of urgency to his politics as well as a feeling of authenticity to his political persona.

Exploring how he is negotiating the realities of ageing, the impact this has on the roles available to him, and his ability to endure the physical requirements of these roles has been the subject of much academic interest, with many concluding that the star is increasingly redundant. This chapter will offer an economic reading of the star and an examination of the ways in which the veteran actor has sought to, and in many cases, succeeded in, extending his celebrity status in a contemporary global media marketplace. By considering two aspects that are central to Stallone's contemporary stardom, his harnessing of social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to publicise new projects and to capitalise on earlier screen successes, and the his recent economic success in the Chinese film market, the chapter will explore how ideas of redundancy may have been applied to the star prematurely.

Despite recent changes in the Indian mediascape, the Bollywood stars' centrality remains undiminished. With the increasing synergy between film, television and digital media, the Hindi film star now straddles multiple platforms, effortlessly essaying the varied roles of a movie idol, a television personality, a social media participant and a transmedia celebrity. However, as the stars engage with social media, often conflating their 'reel' and 'real' personas, discourses of both stardom and fandom become complicated. No longer regarded as simply objects of adulation and veneration, stars are now often chastised and publicly ridiculed for their actions on social media. This shift in the star-fan dynamics becomes even more problematic in the case of the female star, who is often body-shamed and trolled on social media platforms. This paper examines the changing notions of contemporary Bollywood stardom, particularly with respect to female stars' engagement with social media and their subsequent desecration. As the female star attempts to navigate her resignification as a transmedia celebrity, her public humiliation reveals the problematic underpinnings and fissures of contemporary Bollywood stardom.

Findings indicate that the mass killers received approximately $75 million in media coverage value, and that for extended periods following their attacks they received more coverage than professional athletes and only slightly less than television and film stars. In addition, during their attack months, some mass killers received more highly valued coverage than some of the most famous American celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, and Jennifer Aniston. Finally, most mass killers received more coverage from newspapers and broadcast/cable news than the public interest they generated through online searches and Twitter seems to warrant.

What is often understood as social media via social network sites is also a form of presentation of the self and produces this new hybrid among the personal, interpersonal and the mediated - what I am calling 'presentational media'.

This middle ground of self-expression - again partially mediated and partially interpersonal (and theoretically drawing from Erving Goffman's work) - has produced an expansion of the intertextual zone that has been the bedrock of the celebrity industry for more than half a century and now is the very centre of the social media networks of the internet and mobile media. The article investigates this convergence of presentation of the self through a study of social network patterns of presentation of celebrities and the very overcoded similarity in the patterns of self-presentation of millions of users.

Drawing on work in science studies, material cultures and the growing geo-socio-anthropologies of things, the key to understanding the material practices embedded in and creating development celebrity networks is the multiple and complex circulations of the everyday and bespectacled artefacts of celebrity. Conceptualised as the 'celebrity-consumption-compassion complex', the performances of development celebrities are as much about everyday events, materials, technologies, emotions and consumer acts as they are about the mediated and liquidised constructions of the stars who now 'market' development. Moreover, this complex is constructed by and constructs what we are calling 'star/poverty space' that works to facilitate the 'expertise' and 'authenticity' and, thus, elevated voice and authority, of development celebrities through poverty tours, photoshoots, textual and visual diaries, websites and tweets. In short, the creation of star/poverty space is performed through a kind of 'materiality of authenticity' that is at the centre of the networks of development celebrity. The article concludes with several brief observations about the politics, possibilities and problematics of development celebrities and the star/poverty spaces that they create.

In this context, Twitter, which functions more as a news sharing application, Instagram, which has increased in popularity in recent years, and Telegram, which stands out with its bot and channel creation features, are evaluated. The shares on the Cia Medya Telegram channel, Cia Haber Instagram page and Cia Haber Twitter page, which constitute the sample of the research, were analyzed by content analysis method, and it was concluded that the Telegram platform is used more actively in content production, distribution and interaction.

This article seeks to identify some communication patterns and recent innovations in delivering online nationalist messages. These patterns are regarded in conflation with nationalist and populist approaches by political leaders during their digital election campaigns. The literature review approach is chosen to explore the articulation of nationalist and populist messages during Donald Trump's (The United States), and Jair Bolsonaro's (Brazil) election campaigns. Overall, the study boils down to an analysis of the populist and nationalist signifiers in social media posts, and the degree to which their structures of meaning revolve around the vertical down/up or the horizontal in/out axis. As a result, some common traits of modern nationalist messages in online political communication are identified and future areas of research are proposed.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Donald Trump; populism; STYLE; DISCOURSE; nationalism; TWEETS; election campaign; PARTIES; TWITTER; HILLARY CLINTON; Jair Bolsonaro; online political communication; POPULIST COMMUNICATION,WOS,,,,,,,,

Secrecy is also crucial in this type of sexual abuse against children, and many victims do not disclose their testimony. This situation changed, when in France in mid-January 2021, the #MeTooIncest movement emerged, and thousands of victims began to reveal the abuse they had suffered as children. To analyze the discourse on Twitter regarding this hashtag to understand how incest abuse has been dealt with through social media debate. In so doing, we expected to identify the main elements that could explain how people have symbolically constructed and engaged with childhood sexual abuse in general and with incest abuse in particular. In total, 20,556 tweets with the hashtag #MeTooIncest written in French were selected by streaming API from January 14 to February 15, 2021. Their content was analyzed by lexical analysis using Iramuteq software (Reinert method). Victims found a space for disclosure in this movement, where they felt believed, protected, and supported. This movement also embraced the victims of celebrity abusers, denouncing them and calling for their exclusion from public life. Likewise, at the societal level, this movement pushed for changes in public policies to protect children and emphasized the importance of breaking the public silence or secrecy about incest abuse. This wave of testimonies represents a turning point as it has broken the law of silence and allowed the victims to exist in the media space without being questioned.

Knowledge transfer, exchange, and mobilization are common terms for research knowledge utilization where public communication platforms are playing an increasing role, having unique capacity to connect stakeholders in advocacy and lived experience, academia, non-governmental organizations, government-supported organizations, such as child welfare, and research funding bodies. Social networking platforms provide a communication intervention opportunity to test the effectiveness of the research reach. A Canadian Institutes of Health Research- funded team grant in boys' and men's health, focusing on sexual violence (SV) victimization, health, and resilience undertook an evaluation to examine whether a strategic approach involving a cadre of SV experts (n = 46) and their research increased engagement. Using a unique identifier (#CIHRTeamSV) content was shared on social media (Twitter) within an ABABAB experimental monthly format (A = no sharing; B = sharing content), following a baseline entry of researchers. Active Twitter engagement lead to increases in the number of individuals' profile views, article downloads, and citations. These findings encourage further research into the utility of social media for disseminating sexual violence research, and that social media has developed as a forum for evidence-based conversation on sensitive topics of public health import.

Since the creation of #MeToo (2017), and the larger MeToo movement founded by American activist Tarana Burke in 2006, millions are disclosing sexual assaults and past childhood sexual abuse on-line. Social media for disclosing the highly stigmatized problem of sexual abuse/assault was studied to build knowledge about on-line disclosures. Participants and Setting: Participants were tweeters and posters on Twitter and Reddit. Purposive sampling captured on-line sexual abuse/assault disclosures from September 28, 2018 to October 16, 2018 for thematic analysis. Using a phenomenological design 171 social media posts were analyzed for deeper understanding into new options for disclosing sexual abuse and/or sexual assault. Posts were independently coded by the authors. Sampling was stopped when categorical saturation was reached with no new information coming forward on the research question. Themes that emerged showed the MeToo/#MeToo movement is precipitating sexual abuse/assault disclosures on social media in unprecedented ways; posters identified internal barriers, mixed responses from family, and friends/peers, as well as variable responses from professionals. While some conditions for sexual abuse/assault disclosures have improved, barriers still exist. Social media represents an environmental shift for disclosing sexual violence. Sexual abuse/assault survivors have found voice through social media after periods of silence and being silenced, turning to posting on-line when people and systems have failed to validate and support them. Further investigation is needed on the impacts of on-line sexual abuse and/or assault disclosures.

The approaches to contain the spread of the virus have entailed governments issuing recommendations on social distancing, lockdowns to restrict movements, and suspension of services. There are concerns that the COVID-19 crisis and the measures adopted by countries in response to the pandemic may have led to an upsurge in violence against children. Added stressors placed on caregivers, economic uncertainty, job loss or disruption to livelihoods and social isolation may have led to a rise in children's experience of violence in the home. Extended online presence by children may have resulted in increased exposure to abusive content and cyberbullying. This study uses testimonial-based and conversational-based data collected from social media users. Conversations on Twitter were reviewed to measure increases in abusive or hateful content, and cyberbullying, while testimonials from Reddit forums were examined to monitor changes in references to family violence before and after the start of the stay-at-home restrictions. Violence-related subreddits were among the topics with the highest growth after the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis of Twitter data shows a significant increase in abusive content generated during the stay-at-home restrictions. The collective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures offers insights into the wide-ranging risks that children are exposed to in times of crisis. As societies shift towards a new normal, which places emerging technology, remote working and online learning at its center, and in anticipation of similar future threats, governments and other stakeholders need to put in place measures to protect children from violence.

This includes research to describe and specify the control condition, typically 'current care', for effectiveness trials. This paper aims to identify physical therapy outcomes commonly targeted, and intervention techniques and approaches commonly used, by physiotherapists working with children (aged 2–19 years) with mobility limitations in the United Kingdom. Methods: A cross‐sectional survey. Participants were recruited through the interactive Chartered Society of Physiotherapy members‐only online discussion forum, the Association of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists, direct emails and snowball sampling within the authors' professional networks and Twitter. Data were collected using a structured online questionnaire and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: We received 146 responses, 95/146 (65.1%) of which were fully complete. Therapists reported targeting 367 unique outcome constructs, of which 193 (52.6%) mapped onto activities and participation (e.g. moving around using equipment, maintaining body position and walking), 158 (43.1%) on body functions (e.g. muscle strength, joint mobility and gait functions), 11 (3.0%) on body structure (e.g. muscle length) and 3 (0.8%) on environmental factors (e.g. access home environment, access school environment and family confidence). The most commonly used interventions related to postural management (115/133 of respondents, 86.4%) and exercise therapy (116/137, 84.67%) and included techniques such as 'use equipment' (118/137, 86.1%), 'instruct how to do something' (117/137, 85.4%), 'practice' (105/137, 76.6%) and 'stretch' (99/137, 72.3%). Conclusions: In designing trials, current care can be described as a combination of biomechanical and physiological techniques and approaches targeted at body functions and through that to activity and participation. Although some environmental behaviour change techniques and strategies were reported, the explicit use of these in current care appears limited.

This study attempts to use the perspective of framing and cognitive liberation to gain a nuanced understanding of activists’ subjective cognition in their actions aimed at defending their rights. An analytic framework is proposed which examines two aspects of homeowners’ rights consciousness: the referent of rights (property rights versus rights to self-governance) and the nature of rights (reactive versus proactive). Data were collected from Sina Weibo tweets posted by homeowner activists in the period 2011 to 2015. The results show that activists are universally aware of property rights and are increasingly proactive in seeking self-governance. Subsequent interviews of a group of activists revealed a spontaneous and interactive process of cognitive liberation that derives from both the first-hand experiences and the online discussions with fellow activists. Social media provide platforms upon which activists can exchange information, form networks, and learn from each other about common issues and obstacles and, thus, they promote collective consciousness and facilitate cognitive liberation. This suggests that future studies of activism regarding homeowners’ defence of rights should shift from an event-centered case study approach to an issue-centered analysis of the grass-roots rights movement as a whole.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Using posts (n = 975) on Facebook pages and tweets (n = 889) on Twitter handles of Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz from 12 November to 17 November, we analysed how media users reacted to breaking news coverage of a major natural disaster. The results show that quake news gets significantly more interaction and reactions than non-quake news on both social media platforms. For Twitter, quake news gets significantly more interactions such as likes, and retweets, but not replies. However, for Facebook, quake news gets significantly more comments, likes, wows, and sad emotional feedbacks, but no significant difference in emotions such as love, haha, and angry. The emotions people have on Facebook indicate well the nature of the news. With Facebook's new function of reactions including, like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry, makes reactions more expressive and relevant. The study also shows a clear pattern of reactions on the two social media platforms across the timeline. While the number of posts keeps stable over the period, users' reactions soared in the first two days of the quake; The responses subsided after the chaotic period of the disaster was over. The study provides an insight into how mainstream news websites are using social media in reporting and engaging with users during major natural disasters.

We discuss how the sharing and communication of messages through hashtags on Twitter facilitate the perception of the hashtag as a cultural object that activates a political agenda and perpetuates a digital social movement. This study used a novel approach to explore the significance of the echo chamber of emotions involved in digital protests and introduced stages of digital activism. The paper concludes by arguing that during a protest, the activists employ emotions as self-expressive tools that help them connect the issue at hand to bigger societal issues (structural discrimination and inequalities) and metaphors (prison and criminal behavior). Once this process starts, it further paves the way to reaching out for support, encouraging action from others, and demanding change from the government, as we show via the digital activism framework.

Twitter accounts for 25 elite American universities were examined for political and religious sentiment and then compared to results from 25 lower ranked schools. The aim was to examine the extent universities post politically liberal or anti-Christian messaging through Twitter. Results suggest elite universities promote more liberal messages than conservative or Republican messages and more liberal messages than lower ranked schools. Overall, the sample of schools made few tweets containing pro-Christianity messaging despite some of the schools having strong connections to Christian denominations or having been founded as religious institutions to train Christian clergy. The findings add additional insight as to why discussions on scientific issues may be influenced by political partisanship.

Relying on emotions, creationism, religious beliefs, and common sense over expertise deliberately creates counter-knowledge referred to as pseudo-science, troll-science or fake-science. As the worth of scientific expertise is devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through populist political rhetoric help to produce a culture of resistance to science. Our qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts along with the news regarding anti-vaccine arguments from two selected online news sites, revealed three major themes, which we referred to as strategies used by the COVID-19 vaccine deniers in Turkey to disseminate their views. These were: an emphasis on bodily freedom and personal choice and the use of ""my body my choice"" rhetoric; the denying, devaluing, and shifting of scientific evidence; and the dismissal and/or attacking of alternative views and the deepening of the polarisation between the supporters of the COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine supporters and deniers. We conclude the paper by arguing that there is a link between the distrust of doctors and the anti-vaccination ideas, and the quest for alternative knowledge and expert authority.

Researchers have highlighted distinguishing features of social media network platforms: network structure transparency, public self-monitored digital profiles, homogenized network connections, and node-created digital content. These features, while adding utility to social media platform providers and users, can also be exploited to manipulate users' behavior and overall network outcomes. This paper posits the importance of network theory as critical foundational ""laws"" upon which the responsible innovation of social media can be built to minimize such manipulation, how such theory can be used to predict the potential impacts of new network innovations, and the resulting difficulty this framing suggests for self-governance on the part of platform providers. Through a case study analysis of Russian social media interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the value of a network theoretic lens is highlighted. The concept of ""supranodes"", social media nodes empowered via theoretical knowledge and network awareness to socially engineer network structures and outcomes, is developed and the network theoretic features they exploit discussed.

In what appears to be the start of a regional trend, several East African nations have imposed taxes and fees on social media. Uganda has levied the world's first tax on social media users, imposing in 2018 a daily tax on the use of fiftyeight websites and applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Skype. To access these platforms, one must pay a daily fee of 200 Ugandan Shillings ($.054 USD). This Note will use the Ugandan social media tax as a case study through which to examine the legality, under international law, of financial burdens designed to suppress political dissent. While the analysis will focus solely on Uganda's law, much of it will apply beyond Uganda's borders to countries pursuing similar legislation. Part I provides important background with respect to the Ugandan scheme. Part II explores freedom of expression over the Internet under international law and determines what types of restrictions on expression are legally permissible. Part III analyzes whether a tax that affects speech would be considered a restriction of expression. Finally, Part IV examines the social media tax through the lens of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and analyzes the consequences of a determination that the social media tax violates international norms, both within Uganda and more broadly across East Africa.

While immigrant advocates were quick to explain the myriad constitutional problems with this proposal, elements of Trump's dream are already a reality. This Article reveals how a single Customs and Border Protection officer can short-circuit the checks and balances prescribed by U.S. and international law to protect refugees from being returned to harm, and cast a long shadow over a future, meritorious asylum claim. In light of the growing attention to the plight of those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum at our borders, this Article examines shortcomings in both law and practice, illuminating the long-lasting ramifications of erroneously issued expedited removal orders for asylum seekers and their families. Congress designed the expedited removal system to expedite deportations and circumvent due process before an immigration judge. Certain humanitarian protections are built into the system to ensure that the United States meets its international and domestic legal obligations not to return refugees to a place where they would face persecution or torture. In practice, these humanitarian protections are too often improperly implemented and front-line border enforcement officials, whether manifesting bias against asylum seekers or lacking proper training and expertise, routinely ignore U.S. law and the Department of Homeland Security's own regulations. This results in the wrongful deportation of asylum seekers and, as revealed in the Article, in permanent negative ramifications for those lucky enough to make it back over the border to in an attempt to re-apply for asylum. The Article examines the disastrous interplay between two of the ""speed deportation"" processes of expedited removal and reinstatement of removal, the lack of sufficient safeguards that leave refugee screening at our borders in the shadows, and the absence of judicial review. The Article seeks not only to expose and analyze this problem, but also to improve the situation by considering a suite of pragmatic, actionable solutions to close the gap between the humanitarian protections prescribed by law and the reality faced by asylum seekers at the U.S. border. As an immediate first step to implement the humanitarian protections enshrined in law, the Article explores the merits and risks of using readily available technology: the use of Body-Worn Cameras by Customs and Border Protection officers conducting screenings of potential refugees at the border to fill the protection gap.

This litigation is an illuminating example of why First Amendment analysis must extend to government social media pages, and yet raises new challenges. There are logical reasons why government actors may want to exert certain controls over their social media pages, though these controls will potentially run against the First Amendment. As such, this Note not only argues why First Amendment analysis must extend to government use of social media, but also proposes methods for how government actors might structure their online presences to avoid First Amendment rebuke.

This included the creation of the hashtag #12DaysofRage. In this article, I explore how Cho used her status as a celebrity to circulate #12DaysofRage which acted as a discursive intervention in rape culture. I used content analysis and thematic analysis to identify themes in the archive of 2401 tweets I collected. I also performed a feminist discourse analysis on both the tweets and news coverage of the campaign to situate the hashtag within its historical, social, and political context. I argue that Cho performed what I call “promotional activism”, a subsection of celebrity activism where a celebrity promotes a cause as part of the promotion of a particular project or product. Cho’s choice to centre herself in the campaign made it impossible to separate Cho from the hashtag, preventing #12DaysofRage from greater viral potential, but still acting as a resonant, but ephemeral, gathering point for survivor-focused advocacy.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Despite these critiques, the use of alternative sources for news data has been limited to mixed-methods of interviewing or surveying participants. However, the use of alternative media sources that place newspapers on the same level as other possible reporters of social movement activity is available. Social media, such as Twitter, contains accounts from traditional news sources such as newspapers and television stations, in addition to accounts from social movement entities themselves. Thus, through placing the various aforementioned groups' Twitter accounts under analysis to examine the tweets that each group posts in relation to social movement activities, the biases of each respective organization are checked. As such, this study conducted an analysis on a local Black Lives Matter (BLM) chapter in Norfolk, Virginia and analyzed 30 twitter accounts from various originations in Norfolk from the years of 2013 to 2018 to monitor the references of BLM's related activity in the city. My findings demonstrate that there is a difference in how BLM events are covered by organizations. Moreover, through the use of multiple accounts from a variety of different participants, the biases in reporting information on the social movement that each organization might have are counteracted by the other accounts that are analyzed. Future applications for this work include using it with other methods for analyzing movements such as interviews and surveys or to provide an alternative to newspaper analysis.

Social media data allow social psychologists to capture the process of manufacturing and sustaining collective identities and collective action in social movements as they capture a growing segment of the U.S. population. Recent events related to police brutality and the evolution of #BlackLivesMatter provides an empirical case by which to explore the vitality of social media data. Following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, #BlackLivesMatter exploded into the social media sphere. As evidence by protests and unrest in Ferguson, MO and Baltimore, MD, the hashtag social movement to curtail racial profiling and police brutality is still progressing three years later. Social scientists, public health scholars, and activists have documented the severity of police brutality, particularly for Blacks and Latinos. Missing, however, is a social psychological analysis that simultaneously combines the utility of sociological and humanist methodologies grounded in content analysis and quantitative analysis. This article takes up this challenge by analyzing data from a Twitter archive of tweets related to Ferguson. Drawing upon literatures on collective identities, collective action, and which links to social movements and collectivist action, we analyze 31.65 million tweets about Ferguson across four meaningful time periods: the death of Michael Brown, the non-indictment of police officer Darren Wilson, the Department of Justice report on Ferguson, and the one year aftermath of Brown's death. Our analysis of the most popular Twitter hashtags, tweeted images, and narratives show that social media activism is linked to boots on the ground, conflates with mainstream news coverage, and primarily comes from identified leading activists of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. We also show that a concerted counter narrative hashtagged #TCOT (Top Conservatives on Twitter) has operated as the primary anti-thesis to #BlackLivesMatter tweets. In doing so, we demonstrate the vitality of social media and establish a methodological agenda for scholars aiming to conduct rigorous, cutting edge, contextual, and timely research with social media data to focus on a host of outcomes including identity formation, race relations, protests, and politics.

Gender, a social construct, is dependent on its performativity, and this continues to evolve as our media does. This study begins to examine the ways in which gender may be conveyed using social media, by observing the role of gender and use of gender identifiers in over 6 million Twitter bios, using digital trace data. Using this large database of both cross-sectional and longitudinally collected Twitter biographies, we investigate gender differences in the use of gender identifiers, in both individual (male/female, man/woman, boy/girl, etc.) and relational (husband/wife, father/mother, dad/mom, etc.) contexts. The results of these analyses revealed significant differences between men and women in both the types and frequencies of the gender identifiers used, with men being significantly more likely to use almost all types of gendered identifiers. These results may highlight important differences in how men and women related to gendered identities and roles. It may also highlight the ways in which masculinity or maleness is asserted in social media. The significance and implications of these results are discussed below.

This study explores whether communities with higher numbers of nonprofits per capita exhibit greater social well-being in the form of more positive relationships, emotions, and engagement and fewer negative relationships, negative emotions, and disengagement. We use novel measures of social well-being -- positive and negative tweets in a county -- and relate them to per capita nonprofits in relevant fields, such as the arts, derived from the National Center for Charitable Statistics. We find that most categories of nonprofit organizations (e.g., education, recreation/sports, and human services) decrease the expression of negative emotions, negative sentiments about relationships, and disengagement on Twitter. A few categories of nonprofits, those focused on the arts, education, philanthropy, and the environment, also increase the proportion of tweets in a county that indicate engagement and positive emotions.

Migration scholars have theorized that punitive measures like SB 1070 not only reflect the hardening of public opinion about immigration, but could also negatively affect people's sentiments towards immigrants. However, such contention has not been assessed systematically. Using sentiment analysis and a difference-in-difference estimation technique to analyze more than 250,000 tweets published in Arizona and Nevada in 2010, I find that the implementation of SB 1070 had a significant negative impact on the sentiment of messages regarding immigrants posted by Twitter users in Arizona. Further, though the bill's supporters argued that the law only targeted unauthorized immigrants, I find that the law also negatively shaped public sentiment towards Mexicans and, more generally, towards Hispanics. In contrast, the bill did not affect public discourse on Asian immigrants or African-Americans. However, these changes in public discourse were not caused by changing attitudes toward immigrants but by mobilizing users who were already critical of immigrants and motivating a new group of users to begin posting messages about immigrants.

Activists campaigning against the deportation of undocumented migrants in the United States introduced the #not1more hashtag in early 2013, which is analyzed as an example of ""open source activism"", and compared to the #blacklivesmatter movement. The campaign has a distinct topology: there are persistent and well-connected core users and many ephemeral users. The campaign also has a distinct geography: it has four interconnected metropolitan hubs and a large periphery in cities where activism flares up episodically. This topology and geography is explained by analyzing how network communities are constituted. While the exact topology and geography of #not1more and #blacklivesmatter is distinctive, we expect qualitatively similar patterns in other cases of open source activism.

This paper offers a theoretical and empirical exploration of a less-frequently discussed form of solidarity between two diverse campaigns; one based less on shared identity and more on shared values; one that is aimed less at persistence and more at short-term impact. Building upon earlier conceptual work (Wright et al. 2018), we call this form drive-by solidarity because of its one-way, unsolicited, hit-and-run nature. This paper examines drive-by solidarity through case of Anonymous' ""Operation KKK"" (#OpKKK), an online hacktivist campaign against the Ku Klux Klan carried out in response to threats of violence they made against #BlackLivesMatter protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in November 2014. After constructing a timeline of events from available news stories and videos for context, we use over three million tweets to conduct a series of network analyses to model the most significant online accounts associated with each campaign as well as the connections built across the respective online discursive spheres through retweets and mentions. We graph both the period of the 2014 #OpKKK campaign, along with its revival one year later, in order to empirically examine the short- and long-term effects. Although Anonymous acted unilaterally and made no efforts to be inclusive of #BlackLivesMatter activists in their deliberations, the campaigns became politically coordinated. #OpKKK successfully achieved its initial goals; however, longer-term effects were more volatile. This form of solidarity is theoretically compelling because it seems to challenge much extant theory on the role of identity in building solidarities, and even forces us to rethink social movement success. Furthermore, we propose that drive-by solidarity could offer a possible model for other movements seeking high-impact, low cost, short-term campaigns.

Ideal points are central to the study of political partisanship and an essential part of our understanding of the behavior of elected officials. However, current research is limited by the fact that ideal points are based on legislative voting records which can only calculated at the end of a legislative session and cannot be used to compare officials across legislative sessions, branches of government, or levels of government. In this paper, we show how to use nave Bayes and Support Vector Machine classification to calculate ideal points for Members of Congress and estimate the partisanship of individual words and tweets. We validate these estimates by comparing them against existing ideal point measures. We argue that this approach to measuring partisanship has three key advantages. First, it is more consistent with behavioral theories of partisanship as compared with existing measures. Second, it offers a higher quality measure of partisanship which accurately measures partisanship with relatively few data points. Finally, it enables a wide variety of people, organizations, and institutions to be measured and compared politically.

Although cyberaggression on Twitter has begun to receive attention, little research has systematically explored the common themes found in hostile messages on this social media platform. Understanding the thematic content of cyberaggression is of particular interest since there may be differences in the content based on the characteristics of the victims. Furthermore, the topics that are used to attack individuals are important to study because they may be unique to certain groups. In this project, we focus on cyber aggression directed towards women of color. We apply topic analysis and social network methodology to the issue of cyberbullying, or cyber aggression, on the social media platform Twitter. In this research, we begin by examining the occurrence of aggressive, harmful Twitter messages that are directed towards several groups of women of color in the United States, including Hispanic/Latinx women and Black women. Next, we discuss common themes that emerge within these types of communications. In our sample of tweets that targeted blacks, our findings suggest one common theme concerned promiscuity, suggesting that black women are more sexual. In messages containing Latinx slurs, on the other hand, the current political climate in the United States was a recurring theme in aggressive messages. This project illustrates the role that stereotyping and context play in aggressive content on Twitter. Our findings reveal that social norms that enforce traditional, negative race and gender stereotypes, are evident in aggressive messages.

We argue that the various stages of a protest cycle moderate the relationship between the innovativeness of content related to a movement and the rate of diffusion of the movement. To test our propositions, we adopt methods from natural language processing to conduct a computational analysis of content related to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter from May 2016 to July 2016. Our findings show that tweets with less differentiated content are more likely to spread during the initial stage of a protest cycle - which we call the ripening stage - but when the movement gains momentum - entering what we call the frenzy stage - tweets with more differentiated content are more likely to spread.

Although there is a long history of sexual shaming, the Internet has the potential for far-reaching and long-lasting effects. My approach is to frame Internet interaction within symbolic-interactionist, post-structuralist, and feminist theories. I interpret the use of misogyny terms, such as ""slut,"" as an effort to reaffirm entitlement over women's bodies and redraw normative heterosexual boundaries. Thus, the Internet serves as a power structure that defines women in relation to men, and enforces a dichotomous notion of women as worthy or unworthy. I examine the view that Internet misogyny is linked to women's increasing control over their sexuality and fertility, economic independence, and political rights. On the other hand, the Internet's democratic and public platform allows for opportunities for resistance and social change.

We code tweets for their thematic content and elements of message style. We then create predictive models to show how thematic content affects retweeting behavior, message style affects retweeting behavior, and how increasing the number of followers affects retweeting behavior. From these predictive models, we identify the key elements that will affect public behaviors of passing along messages during a high crisis period in disaster.

The paper argues that this scientificity has advantages and drawbacks: On the plus side, for example, it often provides predictive capabilities. On the minus side, these studies are poorly theorized in terms of how these platforms fit into existing theories and research about the uses of information and communication technologies. The paper goes on to examine how big data fits into the advance of social science, arguing that research technologies and mathematization are key drivers of research fronts. While new media provide tools that can be easily reconfigured and improved, as well as providing abundant data for mathematical or statistical analysis, a further drawback is that these data are tied to particular platforms, which limits the significance of findings.

Some preliminary studies suggest that social media has begun to blur the lines between private and public mourning, encouraging users to maintain continuing bonds with the deceased, and helping mourners establish community with one another. However, these early studies have primarily examined highly personalized social media spaces such as Facebook and MySpace. It is possible that the ways in which death and mourning is addressed and/or happens via social media sites varies according to the features of particular sites. In this paper, we analyze the tweet-feeds of deceased Twitter users and find that social processes surrounding death and mourning on Twitter are more diverse than early studies of social media suggest. We find that Twitter users engage in a unique blend of public and private behavior pertaining to death and mourning. While some users directly engage with the deceased and display evidence of ""continuing bonds"", others use Twitter to comment on ""high profile"" instances of death - often connecting these deaths to other topics of interest or broad discussions of death and mortality. Overall, our findings suggest that Twitter has broadened the scope of conversations about death and remembrance in contemporary Western culture by fostering social processes that embody a blend of interpersonal and broadcast-based communication. We categorize these processes along a spectrum that ranges from highly personal, intimate communications to broadcast-based, abstracted commenting.

These messages, known as 'tweets', can be sent by cell phone (as a text message), through the Internet, and through mobile Internet devices. Anyone with a cell phone or Internet access can be a regular Twitter user. Because of this diversity of contributors, news gathered from Twitter is considered by some to be less biased and more 'real' than other mediums. This paper examines the site's role in being the first to report on the Mumbai bomb blasts in 2008 and the downed US Airways flight in 2009 as case studies. This paper also explores the question of whether Twitter has transformed ordinary individuals into 'empowered' citizen journalists or whether their voices are merely subsumed by traditional media. Rather than selectively condemning Twitter as dumbed down or, on the other hand, praising it as profound, this paper poses important questions which explore the possibilities and pitfalls of this new medium and its impacts on social life. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that Twitter is a technology which is socially constituted and digital divides and social inequalities which exist offline persist online, stratifying both access to Twitter and the information flowing on the medium.

This research examines factors that influence the retransmission of National Weather Service public messages on the online social network Twitter. Using a census of all messages published by the National Weather Service on Twitter from 2013 to the end of 2016, we identify message level ""micro-structural"" features and content factors that lead to the amplification or attenuation of these messages. For structural related features we find that the use of hashtags, photos or videos (media), and exclamation points increase the potential for retransmission, while mentioning other users, using a hyper-link to an outside source, and the use of question marks are associated with an attenuation of retransmission. In terms of content, it was found that the discussion of weather-related facts, instructions or action commands, and discussion of ongoing weather conditions amplifies messages, while discussion of future forecasts, weather product information, and community building messages attenuates message retransmission. Our findings support ideas posited by Gordon Allport and Leo Postman (1947) and Tamotsu Shibutani (1966) about what makes information more or less transmissible, as well as provides policy implications for hazard related organizations like the National Weather Service.

This contribution examines the presence and diffusion of these emotions in populist online communications to gain insights into the formation of intergroup emotions. The study applies a lexical sentiment analysis of discrete emotions to a sample of 275.582 Twitter posts authored by officials of two German political parties frequently characterized as populist, the left-wing ""Die Linke"" and the right-wing ""Alternative für Deutschland"" (AfD), and to a baseline sample of 315,536 random posts. Using multilevel regression models, the study compares the presence of anger and fear cues across groups and analyzes associations between these cues and linguistic references to migrants and political elites. Also, the effect of expressed anger on the frequency by which posts are shared by their recipients is modeled. Results support the hypotheses that anger, and to a lesser extent fear, are dominant emotions in populist communications on Twitter, and that populists are more likely to evoke anger when referring to out-groups. Finally, the study shows that anger cues significantly increase the sharing of posts authored by populist actors. Since social sharing of emotions is thought to contribute to emotional alignment processes within groups and consequently to the strengthening of group identities, these findings do not only depict a strong resonance of emotionalized populist messages promoting out-group devaluation but also hint at their potential to foster in-group cohesion within populist online-collectives.

The number of Internet users has increased greatly over the last decade, and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter claim hundreds of millions of users all over the world. A given user, however, may or may not be active (i.e., attending to events involving his or her alters and engaged in information transmission) at any given time, and the number of active users within a given community may vary greatly due to seasonal or other influences. Fluctuations in the size and composition of active user populations has important implications for phenomena such as information diffusion, resource mobilization, and the formation of citation networks; currently, however, little is known regarding active user population dynamics, nor their measurement. Here, we introduce a method for estimating the size of active user populations in an online environment over short time intervals (e.g., minutes to hours). Using a variant of the capturerecapture method (often used for animal populations), we take multiple samples from activityqueryable user populations (e.g., Twitter) and exploit the overlap of users between samples to estimate the total population of those who are active. Results from a large study of Twitter users show consistent and reliable estimates of active users of Twitter over time for many levels of resolution, from monthly to hourly. The estimates show a clear diurnal pattern of active user population, with daily and weekly patterns of active use. Further, with some extension, the method allows us to estimate mean degree of the active user population. Our findings suggest that this method is an effective and useful approach for estimating active user population dynamics in a variety of online social network settings.

State speech takes many forms, including government-sponsored reports, press releases, websites, billboards, advertisements in magazines and newspapers, television and radio media campaigns, graphic messages in and around commercial establishments (such as restaurants, bars, and gas stations), and, in the age of new media, ""tweets."" At times, this speech is direct, with messages emanating directly from government agencies. At other times governments compel speech by corporations--such as requiring warning labels on cans and bottles of alcohol and on cigarette packages. This paper examines government speech on alcohol in the United States. Examples include mandated warning labels on alcoholic beverages, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, and the Talk. They Hear You campaign. I point out the pronounced limitations of these examples of state speech. In the U.S., alcohol warning labels are relatively inconspicuous (they lack graphic images and are small), and carry constrained messages that do not rotate. Not surprisingly, there is little evidence of these warnings having behavioral effects. The major anti-drug campaign of the past 25 years--the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign--largely avoided the topic of alcohol. Evaluation results suggest that the campaign was relatively ineffective, and may have resulted, in some instances, in higher levels of substance use than otherwise would have been the case. While the new ""Talk. They Hear You"" Campaign has not yet been evaluated, it seems unlikely that it will have a significant impact at the population level, as it is quite small and relatively unambitious. I explore potential reasons for the weakness of government speech on alcohol in the U.S., as well as over-reliance on speech compared to potentially more effective policy instruments, such as regulation.

We explore the role of social media for protest participation (in general) as well as for awareness and participation in the Women's March and March for Science. We find that Twitter use offers more consistent effects compared to Facebook in relation to the cycle of protest. In contrast, television use has no impact on awareness and thus, limited potential for mobilization. Social media is distinctive in relation to mobilization, because of social networking features that allow people to learn about specific events, discuss the issues, expose people to invitations to participation, as well as identify members of one's social network who are also interested in participation.

Returning to Sacks' discussion of the 'MIR device', the paper demonstrates how members' produced and handled key 'facts' as inference-rich materials for making sense of the act itself, for attributing 'motive' and 'intention', and for formulating procedural and political consequentialities and alignments using the 'facts at hand'. The paper thus recommends online materials as a means to recover members' applications and use of the MIR device-in-action and as a means of avoiding stipulative or static 'grid-like' formulations of meaning, sense-making, and categorisation practices. In keeping with the conference theme, the paper also aims to highlight the contribution of an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic sensibility for the examination of the (political) contours of contemporary forms of social discrimination and control.

The present study contributes to the theoretical development of digital repertoires of contention by considering the applicability of Five Minute Activism and Fifth Estate Theory using the case of ""#TellVicEverything,"" an e-tactic Twitter users employed to oppose a lawful access bill (the Bill) in Canada in February 2012. Tracing the process of this e-tactic from initial opposition to the defeat of the Bill, this case study employs a mixed-methods approach. Content analysis which values assessment of basic units is joined with the reflexivity of interviews and sensitivity to social relationships of network analysis to enable a holistic approach. It is demonstrated that in this case a crucially important resource was the traditional media which is not explained by either Five Minute Activism or Fifth Estate Theory to date. Evidence suggests use of this e-tactic simultaneously reinforced the power of the traditional media while also claiming communicative power by contributing to the traditional media content production process. The main contribution of this study is theoretical, articulating causal mechanisms contributing to the success of a specific e-tactic. It is argued that access to resources and people should be considered in future studies of the digital repertoire and that the traditional media are an important resource and player in e-tactics.

Using social listening and qualitative analysis software, I examine the ways in which internet users resist online sexual shaming on the internet sites Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. While previous analyses have revealed that online shaming serves mostly to regulate female sexuality, a sizable portion of online interactions can be characterized as resistance to normative constructions of female sexuality. Drawing from theories of agency and the social construction of sexuality, this paper considers the internet's democratic and public platform to allow users to resist and transform norms surrounding female sexuality through hashtags, forums, blogs, and websites. I argue that the internet offers room for multiple voices and perspectives, asking whether these actions can change larger gender and sexual relations and structures. Findings reveal that the phrase ""slutshaming"" has entered the public vernacular, and terms such as ""slut"" and ""whore"" are being used in new ways on social media, but only some of these ways directly challenge the sexual double standard and attacks on women's sexual agency. I conclude with a discussion of the potential for online conversations to transform social relations and social structures at a time when women's basic bodily rights are being threatened politically.

To date, these interactions have not been extensively studied; however, the increasing use of online communication channels by EMOs allows researchers a unique opportunity to observe their public communication dynamics in a time-resolved manner. Here, we observe dynamic interactions on the social microblogging site Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. Using relational event models, we find that dyadic exchange between public-facing organizations is common, despite what we might expect given a ""pure"" public-facing, unambiguous information deluge to the public. While the organizations do self-organize into communicative roles, we also find that organizations may also embark in sense-making behavior among themselves, despite their stated purpose of issuing directives intended for the public at large.

Someone welcome public intellectuals and agree with their point, while someone disagree with their weiboes and even insult them. By using Bourdieu's field theory, 'public intellectuals win more public attention but lose public credibility' can be explained by fragmentation, populism, violent discourse as the distinctive rules of weibo field result in the totally different public evaluation.

In this paper, I conduct interpretive content analysis on a sample of WorldStarHipHop videos. I examine the politics of street fighting as it relates to actors, videographers, audience members, and public viewers. Ultimately, I argue that WorldStarHipHop participates in a problematic project of misrepresenting urban Black girls as exceptionally violent, reckless, and incorrigible.

Aside from similar experiences of accelerated news cycles, digital- and particularly social media adoption reflects distinct professional cultures and their responses to the crisis of traditional news media. German journalists in this study reproduced more than altered professional norms through social media while their advent shook the entire conception of what US journalists did, led them to adjust their occupational roles and expand their professional boundaries.

Online social movements, or e-movements, are notoriously understudied, which has contributed to disparate findings concerning Internet activism. I argue that online movements like Anonymous are fundamentally different from offline ones and require new theoretical models. While Earl et al.'s study focuses on research using resource mobilization theory, this study attempts to expand upon their notion by exploring a different theoretical model; the social movement life cycle. Based on my data, I find that the e-movement Anonymous does not fit with the existing life cycle model of social movements. As an e-movement, Anonymous possesses internal dynamics and external goals that are unique from offline movements and even from movements engaging in other types of Internet activism.

While such actors are undoubtedly influential, these studies neglect the relationships between movements and the dynamics of broader mass public discourse (especially using modern social media technologies), as well as the importance of ""media activism"" that takes place through political films, books, or other cultural products. We study these dynamics through an investigation of social movement influences on the passage of local moratoria against the controversial natural gas extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing (""fracking""). We use data from large-scale scrapes of social media discourse from Twitter and Google, evidence of where the controversial Gasland documentary was aired in public, and data culled from traditional news media, in addition to evidence of fracking activity from state disclosures. We find that (1) the Gasland documentary represented a significant influence upon anti-fracking activism, (2) that such activism, in turn, had a significant effect upon the passage of moratoria, (3) that Gasland significantly increased social media attention to fracking, and (4) that the civic capacity of local communities also encouraged the passage of fracking bans. The results of this study bear implications not only for scholars of movement outcomes, but also for those interested in contested industries, organizational processes, environmental sociology and the politics of energy, and the role of technology and social media in the contemporary public sphere.

Scant research, however, considers the effects of particular uses of ubiquitous technologies as they link and facilitate micro and macro interactions, offline and online, and across private and public spheres. This study examines new forms of communication enabled by ubiquitous, internet-connected technologies, fusing two existing frameworks to account for norms of interaction: Goffman's frontstage and backstage regions for face-to-face communication, and Marwick and boyd's multiple audiences or publics in online Twitter networks. Drawing on data collected in quasi-public bar settings, we examine how bar patrons use new media technologies to broker intimacy with others and strategically collapse online and offline contexts to manage their own self perception in myriad ways. Our new theoretical model accounts for new media technologies' capability to ""tether"" interactions between offline and online planes of interaction, collapsing existing relations within and across dimensions of privacy in everyday contexts. We argue that ubiquitous, internet-connected technologies have altered Goffman's model for face-to-face interaction. More specifically, we argue that in the studied contexts the private, face-to-face ""backstage"" is shrinking, both literately and figuratively, and is likely changing how people both conceive of and achieve intimacy with others.

This derogatory term has been aggressively disseminated by the Chinese government, warning women that they will remain forever single if they do not marry by the time they turn 30. I argue that state-sponsored perpetuation of myths about ""leftover"" women work in conjunction with China's population control policy in an effort to marry off as many young, educated women as possible. The Chinese government views heterosexual marriage as the foundation of a ""harmonious society,"" which is considered essential to maintaining social stability in the midst of widespread inequality and discontent. China faces a looming demographic crisis of tens of millions of men who will be unable to find a bride because of the sex ratio imbalance - roughly 118 boys for every 100 girls -- caused by the abortion of female fetuses. My paper will explore some of the origins, consequences, and resistance to the state campaign about ""leftover"" women. (For example, many young, urban women in China marry in haste out of fear that they may become too old to find another partner.) I draw on in-depth interviews with over 30 women and 20 men in Beijing and Shanghai, content analysis of state media reports, and analysis of comments regarding ""leftover"" women on China's version of Twitter, Sina Weibo.

The protest, guided by Doyle's updates at her blog, garnered widespread media publicity and support from other social justice and feminist activists, raised thousands of dollars for rape survivor nonprofits, and prompted Moore to publicly state on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC news program on December 21 that all rape allegations should be taken seriously, no matter the timing or the person under scrutiny. In this paper I explain why this digital protest was successful and suggest that this campaign exemplifies the unique visibility of the negotiation of goals, tactics, and measures of success in digital protests, as well as highlights aspects of social protest that have previously gone underemphasized. The detailed public record, down to the most minor of interactions, of how the #MooreandMe protest was carried out is a boon to social movements scholars, but also compels them to reexamine their assumptions about the nature and efficacy of protest in a digital age.

While this wealth of new data offers exciting horizons for sociological research, new methods of analysis are required. How can sociologists systematically incorporate digital text into the sociological tool-kit? In this paper I begin by describing how sociologists have handled text data prior to the digitization of text. Next, I describe recent advancements in computational linguistics and the new computational social science. Derived from these techniques, I offer a simple network-based model for analyzing the similarities between texts and locating the emergent themes contained within text-based corpora. I illustrate these techniques in an analysis of United States' presidential inaugural speeches. The digitization of texts represents a possible sea change in how we tell socio-cultural and historical stories. I argue that the greatest potential for these techniques rests at the nexus of new computational methods and more traditional forms of text analysis.

We reason that more mentally rigid individuals should be more averse to dissent and disagreement, thus preferring to interact with others who share their views. Thus, we predict that individuals with ideologies further away from the center should also exhibit greater levels of homophily with respect to political orientation, and that this effect should be stronger on the right. We test our hypotheses on a dataset of 234,042 ego networks belonging to American users of Twitter, which is an online communications network used by over 6% of adult Americans. We find that individuals who follow legislators or think tanks with more ideological or more conservative views tend to be connected with one another at higher rates than followers of equivalent moderate or liberal political figures and organizations. Prior research on social networks leads us to believe that these asymmetries in network composition could in turn give rise to important differences in exposure to political information and success in mobilizing collective action.

The shift from a top-down, provider-generated Web 1.0 towards the bottom-up user-generated Web 2.0 is a trend towards unpredictability, incalculability, inefficiency and less subject to external control; a deMcDonaldization of the Web. These conclusions stem from an analysis of Web 2.0, such as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), media sharing sites (e.g., Flickr, YouTube), open source software (e.g., Linux, Firefox), Wikipedia, blogs and the blogosphere (including Twitter) and so on. It is argued here that the mechanism that allows the trend towards deMcDonaldization is the relative lack of scarcity in digital and user-generated environment as compared to the material world that the concept was created to describe. However, this argument is tempered by the fact that much of the Internet is highly rationalized. Many of the sites that allow for unpredictable user-generated content do so precisely because of their rationalized and standardized, thus McDonaldized, underlying structure. For example, Facebook, eBay and Wikipedia pages look and behave similarly for all users. Thus the conclusion is nuanced: that rationality and irrationality can comfortably coexist online, arguably due to the relative lack of scarcity. This conclusion, born out of abundance, is not possible under the McDonaldization thesis that was centered in a material world of scarcity.

In this article, we turn our attention to the production of addiction on the microblogging social media platform, Twitter, as an important emerging site in which the addicting of contemporary societies is also occurring. Our analysis explores two questions. First, we investigate the ways in which addiction is enacted via Twitter. How is addiction being made on Twitter? Second, we ask how the technology of Twitter itself is shaping meaning: how do the technological “affordances” of Twitter help constitute the kinds of addiction being materialized? While we find a multiplicity of meanings in the 140-character messages, we also find a pattern: a tendency toward extremes—addiction riven between pain and pleasure. In addition, we find significant areas of commonality between approaches and notable silences around alternatives to common understandings of addiction. We argue that the constraints on communication imposed by Twitter technology afford a “shorthand” of addiction that is both revealing and productive. Illuminated is the importance of addiction as a piece of cultural shorthand that draws on and simultaneously reproduces simplistic, reductive addiction objects. In concluding, we consider what these realities of addiction being enacted through Twitter can tell us about contemporary conditions of possibility for drug use in society and for individual subjectivities and experiences.

We argue that Les Écœurés functions differently when read through a sociological prism than it does as a noir or polar.

Second, on the level of character, we maintain that in presenting a drably failed bildungsroman, the novel undercuts the importance of any individual agency or élan. And third, we argue that on the level of genre, the text—by sidelining its own murder mystery—raises questions about the force and relevance of crime fiction as a potential agent of social change. Ultimately, we maintain that the very failures in and of Les Écœurés point metatextually to the novel's position as an artifact of the period and as embodiment of the Gilets Jaunes movement's likely fate.

In many instances, his rambling verbiage makes him impossible to understand. But even when he is relatively clear his bombast and fulminations take away any credence that can be given to his voice. This usually requires clarifications and reinterpretations by his advisors and cabinet. When Trump, exercising the formal functions of the presidency, attempts to communicate with government institutions his messages are absorbed by them to suit their interests, or he is simply ignored. The original design of American government has provided ramparts against a president like Trump and his diatribes. Also, the fact that this president has been largely unable to fill positions at the highest levels of government makes it all the more difficult for him to communicate to them. The traditional media, respecting professional standards, also resist what he tries to say. Polls show that the public is also skeptical of his voice, especially when it is relayed by Twitter. The general skepticism given to him is no doubt due to the nature of his character and behavior. But Trump is indeed heard by his hardcore base when his meaning, frequently veiled, reinforces the current cultural divide in the United States. This divide can be interpreted as the contemporary sharp schism in the American “civil religion”—the sacred dimension of political and social values. It can be questioned if today's political discourse is any more vitriolic than in the American past.

The study applies a thematic analysis of 23,110 tweets from the 20 most popular ultra-Orthodox journalists on Twitter. Findings reveal that ultra-Orthodox journalists utilized Twitter in an ""ambassadorial"" role to advocate their community's security through six strategies: (1) explaining the challenges endangering ultra-Orthodox Jews during COVID-19, (2) dispelling COVID-19 accusations directed against ultra-Orthodox Jews, (3) encouraging social distancing and health guidelines, (4) highlighting the social contributions of ultra-Orthodox Jews to the general public during the pandemic, (5) criticizing wrongdoers who violated the health guidelines, and (6) calling out acts of hatred and bigotry that have been directed toward ultra-Orthodox Jews. These findings reveal the professional ethos of ultra-Orthodox journalists and their aspiration to protect their community. Furthermore, these findings shed light on the vital role Twitter can play in journalistic work through inter-social interactivity and the enablement of capabilities, particularly the capability ""to be secure.""

By incorporating elements of restorative justice values and principles in responding to online aggression, this proposed online solution aims to mediate and resolve conflict between users, and empower youth participation all with the advantages of connectivity and persistence of social media platforms.

Using a unique database with survey data about the demographic characteristics and political attitudes of 5580 Twitter users, I show that, although ideology indeed explains following behaviour on Twitter, interest in politics induces a pattern of selection that limits what we can know about the ideological distribution in the population.

Following D. E. Smith, we argue that understanding contemporary social movements and their organisations in terms of the lived everyday/everynight experiences and interactions of historically situated people, texts and technologies provides a fruitful line of inquiry for further empirical research. We demonstrate the possibilities of such an approach by presenting examples from the Occupy Movement and the use of Twitter during political protests in Egypt (2011) and Iran (2009–2010). Taking this perspective allows us to identify and challenge the implicit boundaries drawn around what it means to be acting ‘politically’ in academic and media debates over social movements and social media.

It is a fleeting solidarity based not on shared identity but on temporarily aligned goals, one aimed less at persistence and more at short-term impact. We call this drive-by solidarity because of its spontaneous, unilateral, and unsolicited nature. We argue that it is a ""thinner"" form of solidarity in comparison to ""thicker"" forms usually conceptualized in the social movement literature. We examine the case of Anonymous's ""Operation KKK"" (#OpKKK), an online hacktivist campaign to expose Ku Klux Klan members carried out in support of #BlackLivesMatter protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in November 2014, and we use social media data to show that, while BLM and Anonymous networks temporarily coordinated during the protests, there is no subsequent evidence of long-term coordination.

It united users from Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in a fight against Chinese techno-nationalists' attempts to shame public figures into supporting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s framing of geopolitics. In the months that followed, Thai, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong activists continued to lend support to each other through their use of this and other hashtags. Why does the #MilkTeaAlliance hashtag resonate with so many? What political contexts preceded the consolidation of the #MilkTeaAlliance, and how may this alliance reshape geopolitical landscapes off-line? We approach these questions from our perspective as activists embedded in these movements. We argue that the formation of the #MilkTeaAlliance unites voices that are marginalized diplomatically, discursively, and affectively by the CCP, and—more crucially—generates valuable affective and physical forms of intra-Asian solidarity against authoritarianism in the region.

This article critically interrogates how Sweden implements the FFP through digital diplomacy by investigating the extent of Sweden's gender equality activities on Twitter since the introduction of the FFP and by tracing gendered online abuse in digital diplomacy. I focus on Swedish embassy tweets towards two countries where feminism is highly contested – Poland and Hungary. The theoretical inspiration comes from discursive approaches to the spoken and unspoken, enriched by feminist observations about the non-binary character of voice/silence. The method applied is gender-driven quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The findings demonstrate that the FFP has not set any significant mark on digital diplomacy in the analyzed cases. The launching of the FFP went completely unnoticed and posts related to gender equality have actually decreased since 2014. There are no traces of ambassadors being subjected to gendered online abuse, but heavily xenophobic and paternalistic language is directed at Sweden as a representative of liberal policies. The article contributes to the literature on digital diplomacy by highlighting the (lack of) links between foreign policy and digital diplomacy and it addresses a gap by focusing on gender in digital diplomacy.

Yet, as tweets only allow for 280 characters, statements must be brief and impactful, which encourages the use of humour in conveying one's message. This article scrutinizes irony and ridicule in diplomatic interactions. Even though these forms of humour may antagonize parties and even turn issues into a security concern, this article points out that they also have an affiliative aspect and could play a conflict-mediating role. Because humour, especially irony, is easy to misunderstand (especially in cross-cultural settings), many warn against using them in diplomatic exchanges. Nevertheless, I will argue that they are ideal for expressing multi-layered messages, enabling the speaker to rely on what is often called 'constructive ambiguity', which is often useful in diplomatic conduct. Two case studies illustrate the argument. The first focuses on cartoons ridiculing President Wilson in the early 20th century for his reluctance to commit the US to join WWI (suggesting that cartoons of the time might be predecessors of today's tweets), and the second on tweets published by the British Embassy in London apropos of the Skripal case (offering an example how humorous tweets can convey multi-layered, complex messages).

It contributes theoretically by arguing that such textual phenomena intertwine with 'disciplinary power', which operates on the bodies of the subjects of power, exposing them to verbal and physical sanctions, a host of complex feelings and enhanced levels of self-disciplining. The article analyses 354 editorials and op-eds related to Sweden and NATO, published in the four biggest Swedish newspapers in 2014–2018; 1408 tweets, with a focus on 14 selected NATO campaigners and their advocacy; and semi-structured interviews with 12 such influencers. It concludes that Swedish NATO campaigners produce and negotiate emotional discourses in a way that targets other influencers and potential influencers by exposing them to ridicule and allegations of treason. While tendencies are similar on both sides of the debate, the article demonstrates that productive power currently intertwines with disciplinary power in a way that makes anti-NATO advocacy seem more fraught with personal risk than pro-NATO campaigning, and joining NATO appear to be the most normal, realistic and responsible policy option.

We used 657 Facebook and 754 Twitter messages initiated by eight of the world's largest hotel chains between January and mid-June 2020 for the exploratory analysis. Under the situational crisis communication theory, the analysis reveals that hotels shared five types of COVID-19 (Prevention, Reminding, Ingratiation, Victimage, and Updates) versus Non-COVID-19 messages. Descriptive analysis and a series of t test, analysis of variance, and post hoc analyses reveal that hotels did not share any COVID-19 information until March 2020. Moreover, COVID-19 messages only accounted for about 20% of all messages, among which hotels shared Ingratiation and Updates messages most often. COVID-19 messages received more reactions, comments, and shares/retweets than Non-COVID-19 messages on both Facebook and Twitter, indicating the attention paid to the COVID-19 messages posted on a business' social media page, which can help businesses spread the information in their networks. Specifically, Prevention, Reminding (although underused), Ingratiation, Updates, and messages with photos and videos received more attention. Such findings extend the crisis communication literature and help businesses develop effective communication strategies to engage their stakeholders on social media during the pandemic.",IMPACT; COVID-19; crisis communication; FACEBOOK; social media; MANAGEMENT; stakeholders; INFORMATION; METAANALYSIS; CONSUMERS; crisis management; RESPONSIBILITY; situational crisis communication theory,WOS,,,,,,,,

This reform attracted positive reactions on social media. Local governments in Jiangsu, Guangdong and Chongqing quickly followed the precedent. In 2019, the central government announced that it will establish national sex offender registries by 2022, although it limited the scope of registration to paedophiles. This study explores how this bottom-up reform unfolded and what implications it has in theory and practice. Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of 2261 posts on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, this study reveals two major players in the current reform: the Chinese feminists who are pursuing a punitive agenda online (a phenomenon known as 'carceral feminism'), and the local governments that are eager to win the public's trust, although such trust is mainly reserved for the central authority in the Chinese political culture (a culture known as 'populist authoritarianism'). Drawing on the findings, this study pushes the discussion about Chinese penal policy beyond the dichotomy of 'penal professionalism' and 'penal populism'. It argues that while the influence of professionalism is evident in central-level policy making, local penal policies can be easily led by populist punitiveness. The latter deserves more academic attention. This study also takes a non-partisan approach to the feminist movements on Chinese social media. It reveals the class conflicts and regional inequality underlying the gender schism. The polarisation effect in online discussion is also highlighted, which alerts policy makers to the reliability of 'public opinion' online. (246 words).

To understand this diversity, we compared 60 Instagram profiles of illegal Swedish cannabis sellers to 70 US-based cannabis influencers' Instagram profiles. By applying theories and research from media scholars on influencing, we highlight various changes in the way cannabis is being presented and professionalized by a new group of actors. Our findings show that cannabis influencers on Instagram are changing the stereotypical characteristics of illegal cannabis culture as being almost entirely dominated by men, to one where cannabis is represented as a desirable accessory in certain feminine lifestyles. Influencers' role in transforming cannabis culture to become more mainstream and acceptable for women could potentially effect cannabis cultures globally, as well as ongoing legalization debates.

It does so by focusing on the case of resistance to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, commonly known as TAP, in southern Italy, and on mixed methods for data collection, including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews and an AIassisted visual ethnography of a large collection of computationally collected and categorised images posted on Twitter. By comparing online and offline representations of protest, the study demonstrated that only a partial overlapping existed between them, thus adding a nuance to the digital criminological literature premised on the existence of blurred boundaries between online and offline experiences of injustice. Themes overlapped in their representations of protest, with images of on-theground visual resistance being used on Twitter to extend and amplify the contestation of everyday spaces and to support offline and online initiatives to stop the pipeline. Differences in the recurring themes were instead reconnected to the inherent secrecy of some of the protest's strategies and to the typical ways in which Twitter tends to be used by social movements.

Thousands of Australians followed the crime event as it unfolded via the mainstream news and online. On Sunday 23 September, a Facebook group ‘Help Us Find Jill Meagher’ was created, accumulating 90,000 followers in just four days, while the hashtags #jillmeagher and #meagher were two of the highest trending topics on Twitter across Australia. This article focuses on the social media narrative constructions of this crime: from Jill’s initial disappearance, to the identification of her alleged killer and discovery of her body, through to the street march held in her memory on Sunday 30 September 2012. Through a qualitative analysis of a Twitter dataset comprising over 7000 original tweets, the article explores meta-narratives of sexual victimisation, ‘risk’ and ‘safety’, as well as ‘digilantism’ and activism that characterised Australian Twitter users’ responses to this violent crime. In doing so, the article reflects on collective practices of meaning-making in response to public crime events that are enabled in a digital society.

Twitter users depicted the criminal justice system (CJS) as having worked and/or failed, and these intensifying divisions were highly gendered. Members of the public pitted notions of the “rational male” against the “emotional female”, and these debates heavily supported or opposed a patriarchal legal rationality. This study sheds light on the ways in which adversarial justice systems reproduce adversarial discourses on crime, and overlook the problems entangled in misleading applications of rationality to sexual consent. The wide circulation of blame to all parties involved in this case leads us to the conclusion that the CJS, in its current punitive form, does not instil a sense of confidence in the public. With a shifted focus on the healing and dignity of everyone involved in sexual assault cases, we recommend Restorative and Transformative approaches to justice as alternative measures to respond to sexual assault.

Policy Implications: In contrast to bibliometrics (e.g., citation counts), altmetrics measure scholarship's societal impact, including its influence on policy. Since Criminology & Public Policy was initially created with the intention of influencing crime‐related policy, it is important to gauge the extent to which that has occurred.

Motivated by this, the overarching objective of this paper is to advance our understanding of how the public responds to mass shooting events in such media outlets. Specifically, it aims to examine whether distinct information seeking patterns emerge over time and space, and whether associations between public mass shooting events emerge in online activities and discourse. Towards this objective, we study a sequence of five public mass shooting events that have occurred in the United States between October 2017 and May 2018 across three major dimensions: the public's online information seeking activities, the media coverage, and the discourse that emerges in a prominent OSN. To capture these dimensions, respectively, data was collected and analyzed from Google Trends, LexisNexis, Wikipedia Page views, and Twitter. The results of our analysis suggest that distinct temporal patterns emerge in the public's information seeking activities across different platforms, and that associations between an event and its preceding events emerge both in the media coverage and in OSNs. Policy Implication: Studying the evolution of discourse in OSNs provides a valuable lens to observe how society's views on public mass shooting events are formed and evolved over time and space. The ability to analyze such data allows tapping into the dynamics of reshaping and reframing public mass shooting events in the public sphere and enable it to be closely studied and modeled. A deeper understanding of this process, along with the emerging associations drawn between such events, can then provide policy and decision‐makers with opportunities to better design policies and communicate the significance of their goals and objectives to the public.

Simply put, it does not matter whether or not there is a superior empirical basis for any particular claim if the process by which the claim is made can be manipulated and if the claims themselves are regularly contested and occasionally refuted. It is, for this reason, unsurprising that public political debate often turns on identity claims instead of ostensibly objective factual ones.[6] Indeed, narratives cannot make sense if we are unable to locate ourselves in them in some way, and thus they always pertain to identity-claims.

The main objective of this research is to analyze the role that these automated agents played in the debate on social networks about the Spanish Government's management of the global COVID-19 pandemic. For this, ""Social Big Data Analysis"" techniques were applied: machine learning algorithms to know the positioning of users; bot detection algorithms; ""topic modeling"" techniques to learn about the topics of the debate on the web, and sentiment analysis. We used a database comprised of Twitter messages published during the confinement, as a result of the Spanish state of alarm. The main conclusion is that the bots could have served to design a political propaganda campaign initiated by traditional actors with the aim of increasing tension in an environment of social emergency. It is argued that, although these agents are not the only actors that increase polarization, they do contribute to deepening the debate on certain key issues, increasing negativity.

By combining linguistic, computational, and interpretive techniques on data collected from Twitter, this study demonstrates that the alt-right weaponizes white thymos in three ways: visual documentation of white victimization, processes of legitimization of racialized pride, and reinforcement of the rectitude of rage and indignation. The weaponization of white thymos is then shown to be central to the culture of the alt-right and its connectivity with populist radical right politics.

While seemingly referring to similar processes and experiences, these descriptions indicate a temporality that is diverse, multiple and changing. This paper proposes that it is necessary to develop theoretical approaches to this temporality, and that it is productive to understand this temporality in terms of the present; a temporality that is both 'now' and on-going. It sets out one framework for theorizing the present and conceptualizing the temporal qualities of digital media, drawing on Raymond Williams' influential work on structures of feeling and the (pre-)emergent qualities of media culture. It focuses on Williams' definition of a structure of feeling as attending to the 'active', 'flexible' 'temporal present', and the importance he places on preemergence in grasping this present. Discussing various examples including social media platforms, devices, streaming services and apps, I suggest that pre-emergence is an especially prevalent quality of today's media culture. I develop Williams' notion of structures of feeling to offer the concept of infrastructures of feeling. This concept helps to account for the amplified significance of pre-emergence, its affective quality and how digital media work across each other in complex architectures of texts, textures, platforms and devices. To flesh out this concept, I analyze the present temporalities that are produced by and productive of the social networking site Twitter and the streaming service Netflix. I argue that these media produce the present differently; creating a real-time, live, connected present in the case of the former, and a suspended or expanded present in the latter. These distinctions are significant; however, in both, pre-emergence is central. The paper therefore concludes by inquiring into whether pre-emergence may define today's structure of feeling and, if so, what this implies for a politics of the present.

After only 10 days of mobilization, the protest, also known as #FeesMustFall by virtue of the most popular Twitter hashtag associated with it, succeeded in halting the hike. How and why did the protesters win? To answer this question, this study combined various qualitative methods of analysis. The author carried out in-depth interviews with all the relevant actors involved in the issue, and analysed documents relating to the movement elaborated by the students in the year of the protest (2015), as well as the main policy documents on higher education in post-apartheid South Africa (1994–2016) released by the government.

Not only have they eased centralized processes of information sharing between social movement entrepreneurs and social movement publics, they have also bolstered the crowdsourced management of public discussion around social contention. This article investigates the use of social media for public reasoning around issues related to social contention. By investigating Twitter streams with reference to the Italian chapter of the 15 October 2011 polycentric protest for global change, this study specifically addresses the use of this medium in the aftermath of protest events of high impact for the general public. The quantitative analysis of longitudinal progression, networking mechanisms and processes of meaning construction in over 8000 tweets shows that Twitter does bolster public reasoning around social contention. It does so as a news medium rather than a conversational platform, primarily providing a space to share information alternative to that available in mainstream media coverage.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood. METHODS In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain. RESULTS Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level. CONTRIBUTION We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features. Linguistic analysis of social media data provides a middle ground between qualitative studies and more standard quantitative approaches.

How do the organizations negotiate digital media, and what are the (intentional or unintentional) consequences related to the use of social media? With focus on the representatives of advocacy organizations, we study how they reflect and act in order to balance various motives, and what challenges and ambiguities that arise. On one hand, there is a perceived need to be online and communicate with members and the surrounding society. On the other hand, digital communication induces a divide between those who have the resources to take part in such communication, and those who do not – in terms of digital competence, economy, age, cognitive abilities, technical equipment and digital connection. The heterogeneity of resources and target groups inevitably challenges both the ideals of inclusion and intentions of advocacy organizations. Today both individual persons and different organizations use social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and similar) to talk to each other, to find friends, to give and seek information about different things and possibly to gain support for their cause in public. Also advocacy organizations use social media to inform and support their members, to speak on behalf of their members and to society. This article studies how different disability advocacy organizations reflect upon the use of social media in their work – how they use it, why, and for who. This study shows how difficult it is to take the interest of different target groups into consideration – for example people with various disabilities, of different age and economic status, their families, and the wider society – and to still address and include everyone. Particularly young people, but also others, might not need advocacy organizations, they have social media.

As we are increasingly coming to rely on a social media mash-up of digital platforms to assist in communications during disaster situations, the issue of accessibility for people with disabilities is as dire as if it was high ground during a tsunami or transport during a typhoon. The contemporary social media environment is characterised by a complex and overlapping network of complementary platforms, populated by user-generated content, where people communicate and exchange ideas. In this environment, YouTube videos are posted to Facebook and embedded in blogs, and Twitter is used to link to these other sites and is itself embedded in other platforms. These networks are increasingly supplementing and supplanting more traditional communication platforms, such as the television and radio, particularly in times of disaster. The concern of this paper is that the elements from which this mash-up of communications channels is made are not always accessible to people with disabilities. This evolving network of social media-based communication exposes the limits of existing Internet-based universal design.

Central to charismatic performances is an affective dynamic which both renders the claim to authenticity convincing and allow for 'the people' to be enacted as a concrete political subject. It does so, however, not in an ahistorical and presupposition-less manner, as some post-ideological approaches to performativity imply, but through discursively patterned emotions with profound ideological ramifications. Therefore, populism is better understood as a performative ideology which deserves our close analytical attention if we are to understand its progressive-democratic or reactionary-undemocratic potential.

A mixed-methods approach was designed. First, we used quantitative semantic analysis to compare the large datasets of tweets about female and male MPs, with a view to detecting possible gendered patterns. We then triangulated our quantitative findings with an in-depth critical discursive analysis of the tweets mentioning female MPs. Rather than showing gendered patterns across the board, the results from the quantitative analysis brought out large inter-individual differences. Some female MPs received comments containing more lexis related to appearance, sexual history and violence, as well as more emotional or extreme language. Critical analysis of the hostile and abusive messages targeting women reveals them to be deeply embedded in a social perception of women's political activity as breaching the rules of gender performativity.

In this paper, I focus on one of the many ways propagandistic tools are employed to control the relevant agenda and information being disseminated by both traditional media and online, in other words 'message control'. Message control illustrates one of many steps of normalization of far-right agenda. The concept of 'message control' emerged from the specific propaganda tool developed by the former Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his followers and implies launching and thus controlling select information via weekly press conferences, briefings, personal conversations, back-ground conversations (Hintergrundgespräche), and text messages, and to financially subsidize only those media that reported favorably about the activities of Kurz's government. Thus, a new media logic based on favoritism, nepotism, and clientelism was established and normalized. This stands in contrast to Trumpism, which delegitimized all investigative journalism without explicitly attempting to control it. Former US President Donald Trump constitutes rather a prime example of Löwenthal and Guterman', as he instrumentalized far-right and extreme-right media channels (such as Breitbart or Fox News) and extensively used Twitter to spread systematic disinformation.

Cats, in this context, play an important role in struggles for social justice, symbolizing freedom and resistance as well as love and solidarity. #AllCatsAreBeautiful highlights topics or spaces around which bonds can be made and communities of shared values or interests can be co-constructed.

Calling out racists reveals some limitations of social justice campaigns,DISCOURSE & SOCIETY,10.1177/0957926520977215,,"Twitter campaigns attacking those who make racist or xenophobic statements are valuable, raising the public profile of opinions that will not tolerate racism in any form. They also indicate how our major institutions are failing to address important matters of social justice. But there is concern that social media, such as Twitter, tends to extremes, moral outrages, lack of nuance and incivility, which shape how issues become represented. In this paper, using Critical Discourse Analysis, we look at three Twitter hashtags calling-out racist behaviour. We ask how racism and anti-racism is represented on these hashtags? We show how these misrepresent fundamental aspects of racism in society, distracting from, what race theorists would argue, is the most important thing these incidents tell us about racism at this present time. The findings have consequences for all such Twitter social justice campaigns.",Twitter; hashtags; POLITICS; FACEBOOK; social justice; Affective communities; call-outs; cancel culture; discourse analysis; incivility; moral outrages; racism,WOS,,,,,,,,

Particularly, the leader is performed as a persona, such as Trump's 'defiant' and Corbyn's 'ordinary' persona, which authentically embodies the mission to save the people from their own enemies, in this case, the mission of national palingenesis (#MAGA and #DrainTheSwamp) and moral vindication (#ForTheMany), respectively. Central to charismatic performances is an affective dynamic which both renders the claim to authenticity convincing and allow for 'the people' to be enacted as a concrete political subject. It does so, however, not in an ahistorical and presupposition-less manner, as some post-ideological approaches to performativity imply, but through discursively patterned emotions with profound ideological ramifications. Therefore, populism is better understood as a performative ideology which deserves our close analytical attention if we are to understand its progressive-democratic or reactionary-undemocratic potential.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICAL COMMUNICATION; Twitter; ideology; Trump; populism; performativity; PEOPLE; Authenticity; BREXIT; charisma; Corbyn; emotion; intertextuality; PARTY; TRUMP; UKIP,WOS,,,,,,,,

This approach was fruitful in identifying correlations between salient discourses in follower profile descriptions and their tweets and suggests that a portion of the followership constructs identity in relation to radical right-wing and populist discourse specifically concerning Islam/Muslims.,Twitter; identity; social media; Community of Practice; Corpus Linguistics; corpus-based Critical Discourse Analysis; corpus-based Critical Discourse Studies; Discourse Analysis; discourse communities; LINGUISTICS,WOS,,,,,,,,

A mixed-methods approach was designed. First, we used quantitative semantic analysis to compare the large datasets of tweets about female and male MPs, with a view to detecting possible gendered patterns. We then triangulated our quantitative findings with an in-depth critical discursive analysis of the tweets mentioning female MPs. Rather than showing gendered patterns across the board, the results from the quantitative analysis brought out large inter-individual differences. Some female MPs received comments containing more lexis related to appearance, sexual history and violence, as well as more emotional or extreme language. Critical analysis of the hostile and abusive messages targeting women reveals them to be deeply embedded in a social perception of women's political activity as breaching the rules of gender performativity.",2019 UK elections; cyberviolence; gender and politics; online hostility; semantic analysis; social media critical discourse studies; UK politics,WOS,,,,,,,,

In this paper, I focus on one of the many ways propagandistic tools are employed to control the relevant agenda and information being disseminated by both traditional media and online, in other words 'message control'. Message control illustrates one of many steps of normalization of far-right agenda. The concept of 'message control' emerged from the specific propaganda tool developed by the former Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his followers and implies launching and thus controlling select information via weekly press conferences, briefings, personal conversations, back-ground conversations (Hintergrundgesprache), and text messages, and to financially subsidize only those media that reported favorably about the activities of Kurz's government. Thus, a new media logic based on favoritism, nepotism, and clientelism was established and normalized. This stands in contrast to Trumpism, which delegitimized all investigative journalism without explicitly attempting to control it. Former US President Donald Trump constitutes rather a prime example of Lowenthal and Guterman', as he instrumentalized far-right and extreme-right media channels (such as Breitbart or Fox News) and extensively used Twitter to spread systematic disinformation.",POLITICS; POPULISM; Argumentation; propaganda; press freedom; 'arrogance of ignorance'; discourse-historical approach; message control; orchestration; scape-goating; shameless normalization; DISCOURSES; Trumpism Orbanism,WOS,,,,,,,,

The growth of this type of discourse has been supported by the expansion of social media, which have been proven to act as a mechanism for the propagation of crimes against targets such as migrants and refugees, one of the main affected groups. That is why we have conducted the first European study of the social acceptance of migrants and refugees by studying the presence of hate speech. The research is based on the perspective of the theories of intergroup contact and mediated intergroup contact. The methodology includes large-scale longitudinal analysis (2015-2020) of online hate speech on Twitter (N=847,978) and its contrast with existing official indicators. The results suggest that personal intergroup contact is positively corretaled with the support of the local population towards migrants and refugees but mediated intergroup contact is not correlated with hate speech on Twitter. We found evidence that those regions where the support for foreigners was higher, there was a lower level of hate speech on Twitter. This is an advance in the study of hate speech by territories and can help in the formulation of action strategies.

Researching online crowds assumes individual participation to be additive as inferred from tweets grouped around hashtags in microblogging. However, tweets may be understood as a type of inter-textual communication rather than spontaneous displays of emotion. It suggests that online gatherings inferred from these displays do not necessarily reflect the transformation of digital connectivity into crowds. Instead, digitally connected individuals assert their individuality to become members of a swarm. Compared with networks and multitudes, swarms do not separate the parts from the whole to imply a type of collectivism that subsists on the contradiction of the individualized whole. Online crowds are, therefore, not crowds per se but an instance of swarming where digital connectivity provides rationalized conditions for individual thoughts, feelings and actions to be grouped into convergent activities resembling self-organization without central control.

Methods: The 10 alcohol brands per country with the greatest Twitter presence were identified based on the number of 'followers'. Number of tweets, photos, and videos were collected and the type of content noted for each brand between 1 January 2016 and 29 February 2016.

The techniques utilised were a mix of those that differed by country (e.g. India: sexually suggestive content versus Australia: posts related to the brand's tradition or heritage) and generic approaches (e.g. alcohol sponsorship of sport, music, and fashion; offering consumption suggestions; organising competitions; giveaways; and use of memes). Conclusions: The flexibility of Twitter, which complements traditional marketing, allows brands to adapt and deliver their online alcohol content in specific national contexts and to capitalise on the cultural meanings users invoke in their interactions with the brands.

Design/methodology/approach -- two datasets of Instagram posts and tweets from Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini are provided. The field of labour and industrial relations include income support policies, welfare, and taxation. Data are interpreted from a rhetorical-framing perspective. Findings -- Labour and industrial relations issues appear to be fully functional to pit ""people"" or ""citizens"" against political or economic elites. Representation of work issues by Italian populism falls short of novelty in terms of framing, even when regarding gig-workers and the platform economy. Research limitations/implications -- The datasets of Instagram posts and tweets from Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini are limited to data from January the 1st to November the 13th. A rhetorical-framing analysis is conducted only on Instagram data. Originality/value -- the paper argues that work should be taken into account as a fundamental dimension of citizenship, thus connecting political discourse and the representative democracy that builds on it. A specific theoretical framework is formulated integrating framing theory and new rhetoric. The framing theory recalled by George Lakoff is interpreted as a modern version of Aristotelian topics integrating emotional connotations.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a form of the Socratic or dialogue approach to explore and comment on various aspects of the tribe mentality that are evident in Dave Ramsey phenomenon. The discourse seeks to deconstruct the alignment of the phenomenon to discover the deeper ideological functions that emanate from the Tribe psychology.

This paper explores the conflict between the employees' interest in internet use and employer efforts to regulate and control these activities. A number of National Labor Relations Board cases and supporting reports, as well as, arbitration decisions are examined in order to explore the critical issues that have emerged regarding employee use of social networking. Based on an analysis of the cases and literature, guidelines are provided for effective employer social networking policies. A high quality policy and an understanding of the changing standards are critical for successful management of employee social networking.

The study was based on a survey using SurveyMonkey© and announced through social media (LinkedIn©, Twitter©, Facebook©) groups identified with workplace violence or bullying. The survey consisted of critical incidents of behaviors that employees had specifically identified as 'bad management,' plus respondent characteristics that might explain their responses. The results show that workplace bullying in the U.S. workplace is a serious problem that is seldom reported to management. Neither age, gender, experience, language at home, having bullied, nor having been bullied seems to influence what a subject regards as bullying behavior, but n egative managerial behavior directed at a particular employee especially in the presence of others is highly likely to be seen as bullying. To develop a theory of managerial bullying, further research needs to be directed toward the causes of workplace bullying, specifically the interaction of elements of the workplace itself as well as characteristics of both the perpetrator and the victim and external influences (workplace, perpetrator, victim, external conditions). Meanwhile, organizations should develop and enforce anti-bullying policies and training programs that use specific behaviors, such as those identified here, to clarify how the organization defines workplace bulling.

Results indicated that the relationships were largely inverse—assault counts were higher in summer than winter, while angry tweet counts were lower. As daily maximum temperatures rose, assault counts increased while angry tweet counts decreased. Angry tweet counts were inversely associated with assaults, with an increase in tweets signaling decreasing assaults. There are several plausible explanations for the dissimilarities including the impact of temperature on behavior, socio-demographic differences, and data collection methods. The findings of this study add to the growing literature in social media emotion and its relationship with temperature.

This study examines 60,449 tweets to and from the news media in Florida during and immediately after Hurricane Irma in September, 2017. Based on a critical review of the literature coupled with an eight-category coding scheme (including second-hand reporting, reporting on self-experience, requesting help, coordinating relief efforts, and expressing well wishes), the article assesses the content and timing of tweets before, during, and after the storm. It finds that thematically, twitter coverage not only covers the storm itself but pressing social issues such as looting, price gouging, the privileging of elites in rebuilding efforts, environmental vulnerability, and abandoning pets. Temporally, the volume of different tweets peaked and dropped at different stages; for example, tweets about personal experience peaked when the hurricane hit the ground while requests for help peaked in the days after the hurricane. The study allows for a better understanding of the sociological, environmental, and even social justice impacts and related disaster response through the use of social media.

Materials and Methods: The research is embedded in the theories of macro-strategies of delegitimization, out-casting micro-strategies, and is based on qualitative intertextual analysis of police statements in order to explain how the police responded to social opposition and shaped their relations with protesters during the pandemic periods. The study covers the following data: entries on official websites, statements to the public broadcaster TVP Info, and tweets released by the Polish Police Headquarters and the Warsaw Police Headquarters. Results: At the macro-strategy level, the research illuminates the online dimension of the protesters' discipline process, as well as the policing of protests based on out-casting. These are the predominant resources of delegitimization of the cause. It is argued that its use was based on the categorization of protesters as violators of both law and social norms. In turn, the main micro-strategy applied within out-casting was criminalization formulated in reference to COVID-related law. Delegitimization strategies revealed the nature of moral justifications for negative attitudes towards protesters, as well as threats from and effective use of force. They also allowed the police to legitimize themselves in the public eye and to place their roles as protectors of human life, health, property, public security and order. Discussion: Unconditional acceptance and enforcement of the unconstitutional law established by the government revealed the political bias of the police. The delegitimization of the participants of the anti-government protests and the active and unquestionable acceptance of the pro-government demonstrations confirmed their political favoritism.

We find that ethno-nationalist and populist themes were by far the most important component of Trump's tweets, and that these themes built upon long-standing myths and symbols of an ethnic conception of American identity. In sum, Trump's tweets depicted a virtuous white majority being threatened by several groups of immoral outsiders, who were identified by their foreignness, their religion, and their self-interestedness. The struggle against these groups was framed as a mission to restore America to a mythical golden age – to ""Make America Great Again.""

This study aims to increase our understanding of the political appeal and mobilisation of women in far-right movements by exploring the identity management strategies Marine Le Pen deployed in her presidential Twitter campaign to construct her position as a female, right-wing populist political leader and rightful president of the nation. A corpus of 701 tweets (published between 4 July 2021 and 10 April 2022) from Le Pen’s official Twitter account were analysed through a critical discursive psychological approach. Through our analyses, we identified five subject positions that Le Pen constructed for herself in her discourse: the Protector, the Punisher, the Women’s Candidate, the Mother, and the Voice of Justice. Our findings show that through careful discursive negotiation between femininity and masculinity, Le Pen managed to engage in a dynamic positioning between a harsh candidate who punishes “the Other” and a compassionate and loving mother candidate who takes care of the nation’s children. This flexible way in which Marine Le Pen claimed different positions for herself may have been a central factor that enabled her to appeal to millions of voters in the 2022 French presidential elections. The study contributes to the literature on identity politics and the discursive mobilisation of gender by female far right political leaders.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Calling for 'targeted sanctions in line with international law against Israel's colonial, apartheid regime,' one tweet claimed that 'mainstream British politics is gagged of the right to critique Zionism'. The tweets were seen by some to be antisemitic and resulted in the English Premier League, the BBC and Sky Sports, which had hitherto been supportive of the Black Lives Matter protests, distance themselves from the Black Lives Matter movement. One month later, during the BLM protests in the USA, Black NFL player DeSean Jackson posted material to his Instagram story that was also viewed as antisemitic. This article unpacks, via these two sports-based incidents, the relationship between anti-racism, antisemitism, and anti-Zionism. I discuss how these tensions are not new, but a clear echo of the tensions that existed in the 1960s and 1970s during the height of the Civil Rights Movement; these tensions continue because the foundational issues remain unchanged. These two incidents raise important questions about how sports organisations operate in a world where sport is seen as 'apolitical' and strive for 'neutrality' but fail to recognise sport is political and that a position of neutrality cannot be successfully achieved. The article assesses the challenges that arise when sports organisations, and their athletes, choose to engage in a certain kind of sport politics.

Sportswomen receive less media coverage than sportsmen, yet the influence that this has on young people is under-researched. Using a mixed method approach, combining the results of a content and narrative analysis of 2514 articles and 2051 photographs from four UK online media outlets (BBC Sport, The Guardian, Sky Sports News, Twitter Moments) with interviews with 70 young people (33 males and 37 females; aged 15-16 years) from three schools in North East England, this paper explores how sports-media messages are interpreted within the framework of a gendered habitus. Two empirical themes emerged: firstly, young people expect female athletes to be underrepresented and sexualised in sports-media, affecting how sport is constructed as unimportant for females for the accrual of social capital. Secondly, media messages that promote female attractiveness are internalised within young people's habitus. The adolescent gendered habitus is influenced by media messages: the prioritisation of sportsmen leads to young women viewing sport as 'not for them'. The role of sport within a gendered habitus reflects hegemonic masculinity, promoting sport for men and stereotypical femininity for women.

Yet, while the plot constitutes a core element of narrativity, it has received less attention vis‐à‐vis other narrative components. Existing classifications of plots have been proven to possess a great ability to capture ""universal"" policy stories, but not the specific variations of different types of policies. This article presents a typology of plots by linking their universal and policy‐specific themes, thereby theorizing from Lowi's seminal typology of regulatory, distributive, and redistributive policies. Empirically, it focuses on the political communication of Germany's policy responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Policy narratives were mined from Twitter and from governmental press conferences (March–June 2020). The qualitative NPF analysis demonstrates that the identified plots—restricting‐to‐control, liberating‐to‐promote, providing‐to‐promote, giving‐to‐give, and giving‐to‐promote—can grasp different regulatory, distributive, and redistributive policies as well as their variety.

First, this study finds that European countries show different characteristics for social networks with regard to COVID-19. For example, the UK has only national key players, France shows a majority of national key players, and other countries have all global key players. Donald Trump played an important role in the social networks of Italy, Germany and Sweden while he was the US president. Second, European countries demonstrate different social networks for groups. For example, the UK shows the most active communications across groups, whereas Germany shows the least communication networks across groups. Lastly, European countries reveal highly different interests regarding COVID-19. For example, the UK is more interested in the epidemic and vaccines, Germany focuses on schools and studies, and Sweden cares more about herd immunity and lockdown.

Background: Beginning in March 2020, public health orders across Canada restricted visitors to long‐term care facilities to curb the spread of the infection. This included family caregivers who provide significant support to residents to meet their physical, psychological, social, and safety needs. Method: We collected data from publicly available news and social media. News articles, blogs, and tweets from Canada were collected from March 2020 to April 2021. In total, 40 news articles, eight blogs, and 23 tweets were analyzed using generic qualitative description. Results: Reports from family members indicate that some residents may have died from malnutrition, dehydration, and isolation, rather than from COVID‐19, because of the sudden and prolonged absence of family caregivers. There are long‐term impacts on family suffering and long‐term care worker burnout. Policy and structural issues were identified. Conclusion: Experiences in long‐term care reflected not only impacts of pandemic‐related visitor restrictions, but also long‐standing funding and workforce issues. Implications: Involvement of family, and specifically family caregivers, is crucial in policy decisions, even in unusual circumstances, such as the pandemic.

In this context, then, #MeToo took an understandably collective turn, translating the hashtag from an individually voiced ""Me Too"" centering on the experience of victimization to a collective ""I Too Accuse"", echoing this tradition of speak-outs. This other approach actually offers the benefits of more expansive and certainly a less blindered view of feminist activism and the #MeToo movement. The feverish mobilization around the Twitter hashtag #MeToo occurred relatively recently, in 2017, but events since then provoke a distanced vantage point from which to view the movement anew.

This article analyses Western news media responses to the Pussy Riot affair. It first examines how the event has resonated across various news media, activist, and social media networks. Focusing on the phrase, “We are all Pussy Riot”, which became a Twitter hashtag following the incarceration of Pussy Riot members, I argue that narratives of feminist return (Hemmings, 2011) and of US exceptionalism have shaped the eventfulness of the Pussy Riot affair in the West. While not dismissing the activism of Pussy Riot, this article asserts that the discourses of transnational solidarity and feminist renewal that the arrests engendered rely on the perceived whiteness and non-Western identities of the members who were incarcerated.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Political leaders employed Twitter to augment their public image and push right-wing campaign agendas to millions of followers. A prominent and strategic use of Twitter was credited to Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, portrayed as a visionary leader supporting economic development, social empowerment and good governance. Within this narrative, women’s empowerment debates underwent multiple transformations. Through this article, we aim to establish the nature of discussions lying at the intersections of feminist thinking and internet technology. We study the discursive trajectory of women’s empowerment against the backdrop of a right-wing political (Hindutva) ideology playing out on Twitter. Utilising the qualitative methods of Thematic Analysis and Feminist Relational Discourse Analysis, we study two cases highlighting feminist campaigns beginning in 2014: instant triple talaq, and the Sabarimala verdict. We analyse tweets in relation to these incidents and highlight the rhetorical inconsistency of right-wing leaders and supporters. We further discuss the implications of this inconsistency for the simultaneous suppression of voices demanding empowerment and amplification of those justifying religious tradition. Finally, we conclude by introducing the idea of the “controlled empowerment” of women in support of our analysis.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Das leadership beider Bewegungen ist mit jeweils einem Dutzend Personen relativ klein. Zur Erforschung des leadership von sozialen Bewegungen bieten sich insbesondere Methoden der Biographieforschung an. In ethnologischen Forschungsarbeiten wird die Biographieforschung meist mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden wie der Teilnehmenden Beobachtung kombiniert. Zentral für die Ethnologie sind weiterhin ein Perspektivwechsel und die lange Feldforschung. Dabei erheben Ethnolog*innen sehr unterschiedliche biographische Daten und verknüpfen diese miteinander. Für den vorliegenden Artikel erhoben Jan Budniok und Andrea mit den Biographien der Mitglieder des leadership auch ihre Familiengeschichten, um mehr über Darstellung historisch gewachsener Netzwerke zu erfahren. Zudem hängen die individuellen Beweggründe aktiv zu werden in den hier untersuchten Fällen oft mit der eigenen Familiengeschichte zusammen oder werden in einem solchen Zusammenhang dargestellt, um das eigene Handeln zu legitimieren. Diese Kombination von Biographieforschung mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden ist eine Stärke des ethnographischen Ansatzes und kann auch von anderen Disziplinen in der Erforschung sozialer Bewegungen fruchtbar gemacht werden. In 2014, due to an economic crisis, several new protest groups evolved in Ghana. The most prominent amongst them were Occupy Ghana and the Citizen Ghana Movement. Comprising of just a dozen people, the leadership groups of both these movements were relatively small. One of the best methods of researching the leadership of social movements is biographical research. Anthropologists usually combine biographical research with other ethnographic methods, most prominently participant observation. Crucial in anthropological research is a change in the research perspective as well as the long duration of field research. Anthropologists thus collect very different types of biographical data that they then connect to each other. Thus, for the article Jan Budniok and Andrea Noll collect not only the biographies of the interview partners themselves but also their family histories in order to learn more about how historically developed networks are represented. What is more, the reasons for becoming active in a leadership role are often linked to the individual's family history. Or rather, activists make use of their family histories to legitimize their activism. This combination of biographical research with other ethnographic methods is one of the strengths of the ethnographic approach, and one which other disciplines researching social movements may well take advantage of.

We conceptualize collective feminist identity by drawing upon literature on identity, feminism, and social movements. We expected to find a politically-defined group boundary around supporters of ""Day Without A Woman."" Using the online tool Netlytic, we collected tweets posted from accounts in Washington D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles. In a preliminary step, we performed a word count analysis and coded frequent words within the collected tweets into categories of meaning. Based on these categories, we drew a subsample of tweets, which we scrutinized in-depth using discourse analysis. Through this qualitative analysis, we show that the group boundary of the supporters of ""Day Without A Woman"" is defined by the common denominator of their negative relation to Donald TRUMP. While the supporters stress the relevance of feminist claims, barriers to identifying as a feminist seem to persist, as reflected in those whom we call ""flexi-feminists."" The boundary between supporters and nonsupporters of ""Day Without A Woman"" hence seems to broaden from a line to a space which can be occupied without complete group entry. In this space and beyond, supporters express feminist identity through an ""us"" versus ""him"" logic.

This perspective allows us to describe empirical examples of protest situations in South Africa and Senegal where ""the streets"" and the media meet. Our research material spans documents, tweets, video material collected online, and ethnographic interviews. In this article, we look at how embodied practices reproduce and manifest particular ""provinces of meaning"" and ""protest atmospheres,"" and how these embodied practices are complemented by social media practices. Our proposed approach not only provides an example of how a social space is created and refigured through social protest, but also allows a further understanding of the situational emergence of protests as collective action that creates ""we-experiences.""

In this context, the social network and microblogging platform Twitter is one of the most widely used data sources. In particular, geospatial analyses of Twitter data are proving to be fruitful for examining regional differences in user behavior and attitudes. However, ready-to-use spatial information in the form of GPS coordinates is only available for a tiny fraction of Twitter data, limiting research potential and making it difficult to link with data from other sources (e.g., official statistics and survey data) for regional analyses. We address this problem by using the free text locations provided by Twitter users in their profiles to determine the corresponding real-world locations. Since users can enter any text as a profile location, automated identification of geographic locations based on this information is highly complicated. With our method, we are able to assign over a quarter of the more than 866 million German tweets collected to real locations in Germany. This represents a vast improvement over the 0.18% of tweets in our corpus to which Twitter assigns geographic coordinates. Based on the geocoding results, we are not only able to determine a corresponding place for users with valid profile locations, but also the administrative level to which the place belongs. Enriching Twitter data with this information ensures that they can be directly linked to external data sources at different levels of aggregation. We show possible use cases for the fine-grained spatial data generated by our method and how it can be used to answer previously inaccessible research questions in the social sciences. We also provide a companion R package, nutscoder, to facilitate reuse of the geocoding method in this paper.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Twitter; WORLD; geocoding; GEOLOCATION; LOCATION; official statistics; regional analysis; spatial linkage,WOS,,,,,,,,

Against this backdrop, we ask how transnational COVID-19 related online discourse has been throughout the EU over the first year of the pandemic. Which events triggered higher transnational coherence or national structuration of this specific issue public on Twitter? In order to study these questions, we rely on Twitter data obtained from the TBCOV database, i.e., a dataset for multilingual, geolocated COVID-19 related Twitter communication. We selected corpora for the 27 member states of the EU plus the United Kingdom. We defined three research periods representing different phases of the pandemic, namely April (1st wave), August (interim) and December 2020 (2nd wave) resulting in a set of 51,893,966 unique tweets for comparative analysis. In order to measure the level and temporal variation of transnational discursive linkages, we conducted a spatiotemporal network analysis of so-called Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). HINs allow for the integration of multiple, heterogeneous network entities (hashtags, retweets, @-mentions, URLs and named entities) to better represent the complex discursive structures reflected in social media communication. Therefrom, we obtained an aggregate measure of transnational linkages on a daily base by relating these linkages back to their geolocated authors. We find that the share of transnational discursive linkages increased over the course of the pandemic, indicating effects of adaptation and learning. However, stringent political measures of crisis management at the domestic level (such as lockdown decisions) caused stronger national structuration of COVID-19 related Twitter discourse.",MEDIA; Twitter; COVID-19; PATTERNS; discourse analysis; POWER; SITES; DISEASE; dynamic networks; European public sphere; heterogeneous information networks; transnationalization,WOS,,,,,,,,

We apply Structural Topic Modeling, an automated text analysis method, to a Twitter dataset (N = 4,376), to understand public responses to the Lorry Deaths incident. We find that Twitter users' posts were organized into two themes regarding attitudes toward immigrants: (1) migration narratives, stereotypes, and victim identities, and (2) border control. Within each theme, both pro- and anti-immigration attitudes were expressed. Pro-immigration posts reflected counter-narratives that challenged the mainstream media's coverage of the incident and critiqued the militarization of borders and the criminalization of immigration. Anti-immigration posts ranged from reproducing stereotypes about Vietnamese immigrants to explicitly blaming the victims themselves or their families for the deaths.

The goal is both show mobilization processes rising from the web and detect main actors, themes, and contents within the European context. Through a mixed method procedure, we tried to identify the main themes and most relevant communities, the main users, the most relevant topics and languages, and the underlined meanings and differences related to languages (as proxies of areas). Monitoring the communication on 3 main topics (""no-mask"", ""covid-19"", ""greenpass""), we noticed the weight of the gap between the government's attempts to communicate information motivating measures geared toward managing the crisis and the perceptions of private users. These perceptions spread through the web with such force the more the emotional, ironic, or polemical plane weighs. In this sense, online communication could be considered a tool for understanding the weight of the interaction between the institutional, social, and private dimensions, with effects on the social construction of identities.

Using 640 million tweets collected by the Infodemic Observatory and the open access dataset published by Our World in Data regarding COVID-19 worldwide reported cases, we analyze the COVID-19 infodemic vs. pandemic co-evolution from January 2020 to December 2020. We find that a characteristic pattern emerges at the global scale: a decrease in misinformation on Twitter as the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases increases. Similar local variations highlight how this pattern could be influenced both by the strong content moderation policy enforced by Twitter after the first pandemic wave and by the phenomenon of selective exposure that drives users to pick the most visible and reliable news sources available.",Twitter; COVID-19; selective exposure; content moderation; Infodemic Risk Index,WOS,,,,,,,,

The goal is to characterize the social context behind GNL. Social context analysis of social media data is challenging given that this data type does not contain the social characteristics of its users and the circumstances under which the tweets were written. In order to fill this gap, I will derive the social context information from textual and temporal features by analyzing the names of locations, companies, and people used in the text and relating these entities to the message of the tweet. The analysis of temporal features will give us insights into the correlation between language use and social events. Our results show that the general characterization of the social context behind GNL is associated with socio-economically rich areas in city centers. Users of GNL in the investigated areas address certain groups of people with words that express familiarity and close social relationships, such as those meaning ""friends"" and ""neighbors"" and that give them information about a political, cultural, or social event or concerning commercial products/services. The temporal analysis by month supports this characterization by showing that certain political and social events induce a higher frequency of GNL. This paper contributes to previous research on GNL in Argentina by testing existing hypotheses quantitatively. The new discovery presented here is that political activism is not the only language context in which GNL is used in social media and that GNL is not exclusively used in big cities of Argentina but also in smaller cities.",Twitter; Cordoba; gender neutral language; Greater Buenos Aires; speech act analysis; textual analysis,WOS,,,,,,,,

The Case of Atlantic Canada,FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY,10.3389/fsoc.2021.655880,,"Researchers, policymakers, and the public often claim that ""extreme"" political views have become increasingly commonplace and that polarization on issues of race and immigration has become a central dilemma for contemporary politics. The popular narrative of political polarization captures tensions that many are noticing and experiencing. However, there is also significant confusion around the concept, as well as gaps between popular perceptions and empirical findings on the different forms of polarization and their prevalence across regions. It is unclear to what extent polarization describes a global phenomenon, as its national and subnational manifestations vary considerably, produced from distinct local histories as well as diffuse transnational forces. While the United States is often treated as ground zero for political polarization, nearby Canada does not appear to be experiencing polarization to nearly the same degree. Using data from a 2019 survey on Atlantic Canadians' political views and perceptions of change, this paper examines whether underlying forms of political polarization are manifesting in the region. We assess whether mass ideological polarization and partisan sorting can be found in Atlantic Canada, looking at socio-cultural and economic dimensions of political values. We also examine perceptions of polarization in the region, using Multiple Correspondence Analysis to observe underlying associations between perceptions, extreme or polarized views, and partisanship.

We aim to identify the perceptions of these actors towards China as unfolding from January to June 2020, emphasising the empirical applicability of Twitter's discourse. By adopting the concept of responsible power approached from a Role Theory perspective, this paper contributes to a more nuanced understanding of interstate relations and role perceptions.

A fundamental belief of the white supremacist 'alt-right' movement is an anti-Semitic narrative that positions Jewish people as a 'global elite' that seeks to oppress and eliminate white populations. Central to this belief is that Jewish people actively manipulate populations of colour, Black people in particular, to overtake white populations in a process known as 'white genocide' or 'the great replacement'. Based on a digital ethnography of altright communities on Voat, Twitter and Reddit, this article demonstrates how the memeified word 'cuck', a pejorative term for 'weak' men on the US political rightwing, draws from and reproduces this white nationalist conspiracy theory through allusions to interracial cuckold pornography. While disguised as innocuous, expressions like 'cuck' provide insight into how the alt-right weaponises misogynist and racist humour in its radicalisation efforts.

Data retrieved from Twitter via keyword searches suggest that in addition to harnessing agency through positive self-representation and ingroup affirmation, the digital discourses of Nigerian gay men recontextualise religion as a legitimising tool, transforming it into a site of affirmative struggle. These resources reach a crescendo in the practice known as 'kito-ing', a discourse strategy that protects the gay community from threats by publicly 'outing' homophobic actors, thus contesting the prevailing gender hierarchy. While Nigerian physical space restricts queer livability, the digital space becomes a locus for agency whereby various semiotic resources are used to refuse the status quo and assert nonnormative sexualities against an otherwise oppressive social order.

Understanding alt-right mainstreaming is important because the movement has embraced a Gramscian view of politics that believes cultural change (e.g. normalizing unpopular ideas) must precede institutional change (e.g. fielding candidates for office). To conduct my analysis I created a sample of 1,000 tweets from six 'alt-right' leaders. I then asked two questions about the tweets in this sample: what topics did alt-right leaders talk about most frequently, and how did they talk about them. My findings suggest that the 'alt-right's' mainstreaming efforts on Twitter involve a mix of techniques. In terms of race, the alt-right is trying to normalize white identity politics. However, the movement is turning away from blatant misogyny on Twitter, instead strategically mimicking conservative tropes about women needing male protection. Finally, the alt-right references Europe more frequently than the US, suggesting that Europe is a geographic anchor in alt-right discourse.

We therefore center Black women's narratives to examine the following research question: How is the white gaze enacted and experienced at work? We conducted a critical discourse analysis of 1169 tweets containing the hashtag #BlackWomenAtWork and identified four mechanisms of the white gaze whereby whiteness is imposed, presumed, venerated, and forced on Black women's bodies. We conclude with a discussion of the white gaze as an apparatus to enforce gendered racialized hierarchies vis‐à‐vis the body and how foregrounding whiteness deepens our understanding of marginalization at work.

This article reports on a survey of union members’ experiences with and perceptions of their union's SM services, to identify whether there is a gendered dimension to members’ use. The findings indicate that for most union members regardless of gender, more traditional communication channels such as face‐to‐face contact and email remain the preferred means of communication. However, the findings also show that women are just as likely as men, if not more so, to engage with union SM. Given that historically, women largely participated less in union activities than their male counterparts, this broad parity of use by women supports the conclusion that SM has substantial potential to improve women's participation in unions.

Such is the power of images of the child they can and have shaped the history of nation states, shifted policy and become emblematic of a cry for change. In journalism, filmmaking, and news media the child can become the symbol of a nation, a conflict, a tragedy and the failure of policy, or indeed the adult world, to care and protect childhood itself. Using evocative images from across the 20th and 21st century, this paper interrogates how idealised notions of childhood become focal and challenged by images which reveal the death, deprivation and destruction of children. The image of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi's body on a Turkish Beach in 2015 resonated around the world. It became the biggest trending photo on Twitter within 24 h and graced the front of hundreds of global newspapers the following day. It also demanded a political response, as presidents and prime ministers scrambled to hold press conferences and generate policy to respond to the Syrian and wider so-called Mediterranean crisis. This is just a recent example in a long line of iconic images of 'the child' that have shaped policy and shifted hearts and minds. The power and influence of these photographs is traced here to highlight where the discursive vulnerability of a single child becomes emblematic of the failures of the powerful: adults, governments, nation states, and global governance. Using the examples of famine stricken South Sudan (1993) and the 'migrant crisis' of the Mediterranean Sea (2015), how these hitherto anonymous children briefly become everybody's child is explored here.",media; images; photographs; childhood; social construction,WOS,,,,,,,,

It argues that because of geographical and social mobility experiences, families have not remained static, and consequently, the further they go from the village the more modernized they become. In recent times, African societies as well as family histories have been concerned with connecting with those who have been left behind. As a result, the blueprint that marks out the African family today is found in its mobility both within and out of the continent. At the same time, what glues the family together is the newer forms of technologies encapsulated in Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), which include amongst many others the cell phone, internet, WhatsApp, and Twitter. Letters pre-dated these new technologies and were significantly used by migrant families to stay ""in touch"". Families began in the village, and as newer technologies were introduced-motor cars, a postal service and motorable roads-they moved or thought about places further away. With later technological developments, such as air travel and the mobile phone, families found themselves in distant diasporic spaces. This paper therefore hopes to make a contribution that relates family history and the history of migration to technology and social change. It also has the great value of discussing an area that gets too little attention in historiography. Fundamentally, the paper attempts to compare and contrast the use of technology, the news that could be shared (welfare, births, or obituaries), the length between contacts, the ability to make visits in person, the tensions that cropped up between family members abroad and those back at home in two periods, the 1930s-1940s and the 1990s to the present. What did these periods have in common? What was different and why? For the purpose of clarity, I will start the paper with a short introduction about the area, the issues of family formation, and kfaang. The second part of the paper will focus on the discussion of the ""newness"" of those who migrated to more modern places and the role of technology. The third part compares/contrasts the connections of families in the two periods (1930s-1940s and 1990s-present) in order to flesh out the argument.",communication technology; modernity; family; Cameroon; kfaang; Kom,WOS,,,,,,,,

While a growing body of research examined hostile ageism during the pandemic, benevolent ageism received less attention. Drawing on the stereotype content theory and the classic tripartite model of attitudes, the current study explored how benevolent and hostile ageism are reflected in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of attitudes toward older adults in German COVID-19-related tweets. The study examined the most prevalent attitudes as well as changes in prevalence between the first and second lockdown period in Germany. Research Design and Methods Seven hundred and ninety-two German tweets concerning COVID-19 and aging were collected and coded using Mayring's qualitative content analysis with a dominantly inductive approach. Quantitative methods were used to identify the most prevalent subthemes as well as changes in prevalence. Results The coding resulted in 21 subthemes. Most tweets (60.73%) contained either hostile or benevolent ageist attitudes, with benevolent ageism being more prevalent. The top 5 subthemes in terms of prevalence and reach contained several opposing attitudes, such as devaluation and opposing devaluation. The chi-square tests revealed a shift from a promotion to an evaluation of COVID-19-related policies between the 2 lockdowns. Discussion and Implications Results highlight social media's polarizing effect and its potential contribution to both hostile and benevolent ageism in the context of COVID-19 in Germany.

The research highlights conflict and connection surrounding generational cohorts via social media, particularly in a time of crisis. Research Design and Methods The study used an inductive-dominant qualitative content analysis to examine 536 tweets collected between March 9 and April 9, 2020 under #BoomerRemover. Results Data analysis revealed five forms of conflictive generational discourse: derogatory endorsement of the #BoomerRemover moniker, conflict regarding the nature and origins of the moniker, conflict surrounding the virus, political conflict, and generational jabs. Two forms of intergenerationally unifying discourse were identified: implicit and explicit pleas for connectivity. Discussion and Implications The analysis of discourse under #BoomerRemover revealed more nuanced expressions surrounding generational cohorts than widely reported in media outlets. Some users tweeted the hashtag in ways that reflected conflict, with #BoomerRemover acting as a vector through which stereotypes were perpetuated and magnified. However, a number of users tweeted the hashtag to call for intergenerational connectivity, highlighting the complexity of online discourse. These results yield implications for the study of online generational discourse, particularly in light of the unique circumstances surrounding the pandemic.

499,journalArticle,2022.0,"Ng, Reuben; Indran, Nicole",Hostility Toward Baby Boomers on TikTok.,Gerontologist,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=159060140&site=ehost-live,"Background and Objectives The recent entry of the hashtag #OkBoomer into social media vernacular underscores the collective frustration of younger people with a group whose views they find increasingly incompatible with theirs. Most social media analyses in gerontology focus on the content on Twitter and Facebook, with content on TikTok virtually unexplored. Given the burgeoning popularity of TikTok among younger people, we assess the content of TikTok videos with the hashtags #OkBoomer or #Boomer to distill the undercurrents of hostility expressed by younger people toward Baby Boomers. Research Design and Methods We collated TikTok videos (N = 332) with the hashtags #OkBoomer or #Boomer, which received over 5.4 billion views. Both inductive and deductive approaches guided the qualitative content analysis of the videos. Results Five themes emerged. Most videos (79%) described ""Negative Encounters with Baby Boomers"" (Theme 1); 58% were about ""Conflicting Values/Beliefs between Baby Boomers and Younger People"" (Theme 2); 39% were about ""Baby Boomers Antagonizing Younger Generations"" (Theme 3); 22% of the videos made references to the ""Karen Meme"" (Theme 4); and 7% bemoaned the existence of a ""Wealth Gap"" between Baby Boomers and younger people (Theme 5). Discussion and Implications Findings reveal that the usage of the hashtags #OkBoomer and #Boomer is highly nuanced, at times explicitly ageist, and at others, emblematic of a phenomenon far more complex than ageism. There is a need to leverage social media as a space to foster interaction between older and younger people. Society is ultimately well served by intergenerational interaction.
