The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of financial event announcements via social media, specifically Twitter, on share returns of stocks on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. Our research questions were tested on a sample of 833 event observations retrieved from official Twitter accounts for two years (1 January 2014 - 16 February 2016). The test was concerned with tracking stock return behavior on the event day (day 0), the pre-event window and the post-event window using the event-study methodology. This study found that there is a significant relationship between share prices and the events announced via Twitter, the type of tweets, news categories and tweeting intensity of the company involved.

Existing studies using mobile phone data revealed distinct and recurrent transitional activity patterns, known as mobility motifs, in people's daily lives. The limitation in using only a few inferred activity types hinders our ability to examine general patterns in detail. We proposed a mobility network approach with geographic context-aware Twitter data to investigate granular daily activity patterns in the urban environment. We first used publicly accessible geolocated tweets to track the movements of individuals in two major U.S. cities, Chicago and Greater Boston, where each recorded location is associated with its closest land use parcel to enrich its geographic context. A direct mobility network represents the daily location history of the selected active users, where the nodes are physical places with semantically labeled activity types and the edges represent the transitions. Analyzing the isomorphic structure of the mobility networks uncovered sixteen types of location-based motifs, which describe over 83 percent of the networks in both cities and are comparable to those from previous studies. With detailed and semantically labeled transitions between every two activities, we further dissected the general location-based motifs into activity-based motifs, where sixteen common activity-based motifs describe more than 57 percent of transitional behaviors in the daily activities in the two cities. The integration of geographic context from the synthesis of geolocated Twitter data with land use parcels enables us to reveal unique activity motifs that form the fundamental elements embedded in complex urban activities.

These responses and behaviors could be better understood by analyzing real-time social media data through categorizing them into the three phases of the emergency management: preparedness, response, and recovery. This study analyzes the spatial-temporal patterns of Twitter activities during Hurricane Sandy, which struck the U.S. Northeast on 29 October 2012. The study area includes 126 counties affected by Hurricane Sandy. The objectives are threefold: (1) to derive a set of common indexes from Twitter data so that they can be used for emergency management and resilience analysis; (2) to examine whether there are significant geographical and social disparities in disaster-related Twitter use; and (3) to test whether Twitter data can improve postdisaster damage estimation. Three corresponding hypotheses were tested. Results show that common indexes derived from Twitter data, including ratio, normalized ratio, and sentiment, could enable comparison across regions and events and should be documented. Social and geographical disparities in Twitter use existed in the Hurricane Sandy event, with higher disaster-related Twitter use communities generally being communities of higher socioeconomic status. Finally, adding Twitter indexes into a damage estimation model improved the adjusted R2 from 0.46 to 0.56, indicating that social media data could help improve postdisaster damage estimation, but other environmental and socioeconomic variables influencing the capacity to reducing damage might need to be included. The knowledge gained from this study could provide valuable insights into strategies for utilizing social media data to increase resilience to disasters.

By focusing on the cases of three people gone missing, we report on ways in which civil society establishes relational networks through social media to collectively support local searches and share information in rural Sweden. Geographical information systems and visualization techniques underlie the methodology of this study. Findings show that the geography of information sharing in social media about a missing person is not random, revealing a globally dispersed pattern across the country. Information sharing contains more emotional than informational content, hitting a peak of spread after a person is found deceased. This finding indicates that the value of information shared by social media as a problem-solving resource might have so far been overestimated in the process of finding missing persons. In addition, tweets show indications that voluntary organizations constitute a valuable resource in rural contexts but not without impact on the existing networks of stakeholders delivering emergency services.

When empowered by pervasive location acquisition technologies, location-based social media (LBSM) has become a potential resource for smart city applications to characterize social perceptions of place and model human activities. There is a lack of systematic examination of the representativeness of LBSM data, though. If LBSM data are applied to decision making in smart city services, such as emergency response or transportation, it is essential to understand their limitations to implement better policies or management practices. This study formalizes the sampling biases of LBSM data from various perspectives, including sociodemographic, spatiotemporal, and semantic. This article examines LBSM data representativeness issues using empirical cases and discusses the impacts on smart city applications. The results provide insights for understanding the limitations of LBSM data for smart city applications and for developing mitigation approaches.

To reduce fatalities and economic losses, coastal states and counties take protective actions, including sheltering in place and evacuation away from the coast. Not everyone adheres to hurricane evacuation warnings or orders. In reality, evacuation rates are far less than 100 percent and are estimated using posthurricane questionnaire surveys to residents in the affected area. To overcome limitations of traditional data collection methods that are costly in time and resources, an increasing number of natural hazards studies have used social media data as a data source. To better understand social media users' evacuation behaviors, this article investigates whether activity space, social network, and long-term sentiment trends are associated with individuals' evacuation decisions by measuring and comparing Twitter users' evacuation decisions during Hurricane Matthew in 2016. We find that (1) evacuated people have larger long-term activity spaces than nonevacuated people, (2) people in the same social network tend to make the same evacuation decision, and (3) evacuated people have smaller long-term sentimental variances than nonevacuated people. These results are consistent with previous studies based on questionnaire and survey data and thus provide researchers a new method to study human behavior during disasters.

For example, showing where people are tweeting during a disaster might be interesting, but visually identifying where normal signals are missing could in fact highlight the most affected places. Parcel data might be fully present, but attributes of their observations could convey qualities of absence (e.g., abandoned structures). Current geovisualization approaches normally do not show anything at all when data are missing or contain qualities of absence and only in rare cases might use a specific hue to highlight the presence of absence on maps. This work argues that people perceive missingness and absence in a way that is distinct from other spatial data qualities, and we propose a typology of static and dynamic means by which we can draw user attention to the presence of absence. To explore the application of these techniques, I use urban parcel data to visualize patterns of property blight in a Detroit neighborhood. Based on conceptual development and case study application, I propose research challenges to evaluate visual representations of missing and absent information on maps.

From participatory methods to the invention of the participatory geoweb and finally to geospatial social media sources, the amount of information available to nonquantitative GIScientists has grown tremendously. Recently, researchers have advanced qualitative GIS by taking advantage of new data sources, like Twitter, to illustrate the occurrence of various phenomena in the data set geospatially. At the same time, computer scientists in the field of natural language processing have built increasingly sophisticated methods for digesting and analyzing large text-based data sources. In this article, the authors implement one of these methods, topic modeling, and create a visualization method to illustrate the results in a visually comparative way, directly onto the map canvas. The method is a step toward making the advances in natural language processing available to all GIScientists. The article discusses the ways in which geography plays an important part in understanding the results presented from the model and visualization, including issues of place and space.

We collected data on all environmental events, such as executive actions at the federal level or Trump's tweets. Likewise, we documented racist events targeting indigenous people, people of color, Muslims, and South Asians or Arabs. We found important differences in how these agendas unfolded: Environmental events were more likely to be concrete actions, whereas racist events were more likely to involve ""noisy"" rhetoric. The differing forms are not associated with particular levels of harm; rather, they suggest the unanticipated and complex ways in which racism intersects with environmental governance under neoliberal, authoritarian regimes. We argue that Trump's ""spectacular racism,"" characterized by sensational visibility, helps obscure the profound deregulation underway. The white nation plays a critical role, as Trump uses spectacular racism to nurture his base, consolidate his power, and implement his agenda. Such an analysis expands how environmental racism is typically conceptualized. Key Words: environmental deregulation, spectacular racism, Trump, white nation.

Based on data for such short periods, these space–time paths might not be able to show regular activity patterns, which are pertinent to various types of planning and policy analysis. Travel data gathered for longer periods might capture regular activity patterns, but footprints captured by these data also include irregular activities, introducing noises or uncertainty. Our objective is to determine the representative spatiotemporal trajectories of individuals, accounting for stochastic disturbances and spatiotemporal variability, but using activity data with longer duration. Therefore, we explore using Twitter data, which have relatively low and irregular spatial and temporal resolutions. This article introduces a methodology to construct individual representative space–time paths using various aggregation and spatiotemporal clustering techniques. To depict and visualize spatiotemporal trajectories with uncertain information, we propose space–time cones of variable sizes to reflect the spatial precision of the paths and use colors on the cones to represent the confidence level. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we use the geo-tagged tweets for an extended period. Our analysis indicates that the representative space–time path reasonably describes an individual's regular activity patterns. As visual elements, cones and cone colors effectively show the varying geographical precision along the path and changing certainty levels across different path segments, respectively.

Tweets about a destination were collected while the destination hosted a hallmark event over a 5-year period (2011-2015). In each year, interactions on Twitter were analysed using macro and meso-level social network analysis to identify the network structure and hubs of eWOM activity. A K means clustering algorithm was then applied to create clusters of nodes with similar characteristics and eWOM content within each cluster was analysed using automated content analysis. The resulting model indicates that destination and event eWOM maintains a macro network structure in which a small number of accounts or hubs influence information sharing. Hub characteristics evolve over time, whereas eWOM content can fluctuate in response to emergent destination activities. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Exploring the relation between what they referred to as 'the spatial and statist orders,' they argued that conceptualizations of the nature of the state have not attended adequately to the ways in which states are spatialized and endeavored to show, through ethnography, how people come to experience the state as an entity with certain spatial characteristics and properties. Building on these ideas, but also moving beyond their taken-for-granted assumptions about the state's spatiality, this essay makes use of one ethnographic case example in an effort to offer a fine-grained illustration of the spatial dimensions of the project of state securitization in the urban landscape. I do this by looking closely at the field of urban mobility in Beirut, Lebanon, and the Twitter account for the city's Traffic Management Center, launched in late 2013 by the Ministry of Interior. Through my analysis of the spatial modes of statecraft that are produced through this Twitter account, I develop an argument about how the social media technology of Twitter serves as a portal through which to view how the state secures its legitimacy and naturalizes its authority in both virtual and physical space, while, at the same time, this technology - if only fleetingly - can be harnessed to issue challenges to this legitimacy and authority. What is at stake in the Traffic Management Center's Twitter account, I suggest, is the production of the state as an entity that is not just powerful in the sense of being vertical to society and encompassing of urban space, but the very idea that the state offers security and protection to its citizens.

Using an autoethnographical perspective, the paper employs a critical diversity literacy reading of texts on the protests in three online newspapers.

The story acted as a kind of 'accidental Olympics', evoking national sentiment and global communitas, and offering more than a billion people the chance to peek into the lives of the miners and their families. But responses to the rescue were not the same everywhere. This article examines responses in Mexico. Whereas elsewhere the story's appeal lay in its capacity to be presented as a 'politics-free zone', this seemed to be less the case in Mexico. Some Mexican publics, at least, were relatively immune to the apolitical 'inspiration' offered by the media and enthusiastically taken up elsewhere. This is because many Mexicans see a painful contrast between circumstances in their country and those in Chile. This sense of contrast manifested itself not only in a lower degree of 'buy-in' to the feel-good aspect of the story in Mexico, but also in a surge of ill-feeling and protest against the Mexican government, and in a telling spate of jokes that did the rounds in October and November, which were disseminated on Twitter and YouTube and reported in television and print media. The jokes followed the formula: 'If the [Chilean] miners had been Mexican...' and drew on strains of social and political satire with a long history in Mexico.

In study 1, a dataset of Facebook status updates (n = 72,559) were analyzed and it was found that those who mentioned ownership of a cat (by using the phrase ""my cat"" (n = 5,053)) in their status updates were more open to experience, introverted, neurotic, and less conscientious when compared with the general population. Users mentioning ownership of a dog (by using ""my dog"" (n = 8,045)) were only less conscientious compared with the rest of the population. In study 2, a dataset of Twitter images was analyzed and revealed that users who featured either cat (n = 1,036) or dog (n = 1,499) images in their tweets were more neurotic, less conscientious, and less agreeable than those who did not. In addition, posting images containing cats was specific to users higher in openness, while posting images featuring dogs was associated with users higher in extraversion. These findings taken together align with some previous findings on the relationship between owner personality and animal preference, additionally highlighting some social media-specific behaviors.",Twitter; FACEBOOK; social media; Facebook; Big Five; cat people; CAT PEOPLE; COMPANIONS; dog people; DOG PEOPLE; PET OWNERSHIP; TRAITS,WOS,4,,,,,,,

It examines the level of social media adoption by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in protecting Filipino nationals abroad. The popularity of social networking sites among Filipinos, including DFA officials and staff, played a vital role in influencing the institution's move toward social media adoption. Key informant interviews were conducted with 10 officials, case officers, and staff at the DFA home office and Foreign Service Posts in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from June to July 2019. While Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can be effective tools for speedy communication between the DFA and OFWs, the DFA faces several challenges such as budgetary constraints, lack of human resources with ICT skills, and verifying reports, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the indispensable role of social media platforms in communicating with OFWs and in extending assistance to those in distress. Hence, the DFA may consider the formulation of an agency-wide social media strategy and collaboration with other migration authorities on social media-anchored projects.

Given the ideological connotations in the construct of people's concerns about economic inequality, whether those who live in more unequal countries are more interested in economic inequality remains unclear. In this research, we aimed to examine whether objective economic inequality is related to individuals' interest in the topic of economic inequality. First, we used data from the United States Census Bureau and Google Trends to examine whether the objective level of economic inequality predicted the interest of the population in searching Google for terms such as ""economic inequality"" and ""income inequality."" Our results showed that individuals who live in more economically unequal U.S. states more often search these terms. Second, we analysed the tweets that contained the terms ""economic inequality"" and ""income inequality"" (10,118 tweets) published over 9 days and localised by U.S. state. We found that individuals who live in more economically unequal U.S. states more often post tweets about economic and income inequality. To take a closer look at the narrative around economic/income inequality, we conducted a network analysis using tweets as nodes and retweets as edges. Our results suggest that the public narrative about economic inequality via Twitter was built on three large communities. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in relation to economic inequality consequences.

First, to what extent is awe a relevant emotion in consumer experiences of products? A pilot study examined contents of tweets containing ""awe"" and showed that it was frequently used in people's voluntary expressions. Study 1 showed that products could elicit awe among a significant portion of consumers. Second, what kind of product triggers awe in consumers? Study 2 determined that descriptions of awe-inspiring products typically featured four dimensions: timelessness, accommodation, beauty, and vastness. Studies 3 and 4 showed that only timelessness and accommodation could differentiate awe from admiration (Study 3) and love (Study 4) whereas beauty and vastness were not as important. The third question relates to the consequences produced by awe-inspiring products. Study 3 showed that awe comprised a blend of positive and negative emotions. Studies 3 to 5 showed that awe not only made products more memorable but also enhanced consumers' intentions to spread positive word-of-mouth publicity and to purchase the product. These findings shed light on the folk understanding and expression of this emotion and establish key landmarks in the hitherto uncharted consumer research domain of awe.

To further understand the advertising practices during this period, we aimed to determine whether packaged liquor retailers increased their posts during COVID‐19 or used COVID‐19 to promote alcohol on Twitter. Methods: 'Tweets' (Twitter posts) from all packaged liquor retailers in NSW written since 2018 were collected. Tweets written during the first COVID‐19 lockdown period were coded for: references of COVID‐19, types of marketing message, use of links to online stores and use of an alcohol‐related 'meme'. Results: There was no evidence of increased tweet frequency, however, some COVID‐specific alcohol advertising was detected that leveraged the pandemic (4.0%) or referencing the pandemic without explicitly promoting alcohol (12.0%). The most popular market messages used in the tweets were encouraging alcohol use (15.4%) and easy access to alcohol at home (9.5%). Conclusions: At least on Twitter, there was no marked increase in posts from packaged liquor retailers in NSW and only some tweets used COVID‐19 to promote alcohol. Implications for public health: The use of COVID‐specific alcohol marketing on social media raises important considerations for legislative and regulatory requirements, particularly during major health events such as a pandemic.

This brief report examines the themes of responses on Twitter to this announcement. Methods: Simple random sampling was used to retrieve tweets containing keywords from 19 to 26 June 2020. Tweets were manually coded and descriptive statistics calculated for themes and policy position. Results: The vast majority of the 1,168 tweets were anti‐policy. Themes included: criticism towards government (59.8%), activism against NVP restriction (38%), potential adverse consequences (30.8%) and support for NVP restriction (1.4%). Tweets that identified potential adverse consequences of NVP restriction cited: smoking relapse for individuals currently using NVPs (75.6%); the impact of policy enforcement (8.6%); illicit market (8.3%); panic buying (3.6%); difficulty obtaining prescriptions (2.8%); and impacts on NVP businesses (2.8%). Conclusion: Tweets predominately objected to the policy announcement. Approximately three‐quarters of tweets that cited potential adverse consequences of the policy mentioned smoking relapse as their primary concern.

Methods: Thematic content analysis was employed to code the textual and visual elements of the data that were extracted from the online media pages of nine energy drinks, including posts on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and content of websites and advergames. Results: Four main themes were derived from the 624 textual and visual elements of digital marketing content of energy drink brands, including online social connectivity, desired social identity, enhancement of performance and enhancement of mood. Conclusions: Energy drinks were popular on digital platforms, as evidenced by the large volume of user‐engagement (e.g. 'likes' and 'comments') especially on social networking sites. Energy drink brands appear to target young people, given that the marketing appeals are likely attuned with young people's desires or aspirations.

Successive Australian and state/Territory governments have selectively overreached, so as to restrict freedom of speech, and the I Banerji i judgment reaffirms that the existing constitutional apparatus provides very little recourse against this. The most significant problems arising from - or perhaps highlighted in - the I Banerji i judgment are the lack of robust protections for freedom of speech in Australia, particularly in federal law; a Government that selectively overreaches on freedom of speech; and the absence of an exogenous and comprehensive set of human rights standards against which to hold the Government to account.
