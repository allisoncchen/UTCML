The rise in allthings geographicâfrom cartographic representations of news stories to automated alerts for nearbyfriends and businessesâcoupled with an existing set of social networking models has produced a newarray of 'socio-locative' frameworks and inspired a host of 'socio-locative' practices. Building onethnographic data from interviews and collected artifacts, this paper suggests that individuals'inclusion of location references when microblogging (Twitter and Jaiku) or sharing photographsonline (Flickr) constitutes three distinguishable patterns of communication: one, citizen and proxymicrobroadcasting, in which broadcasters inform community members of timely, salient place-relatedinformation within a shared geographical context; two, documentary broadcasting, in whichbroadcasters curate lasting descriptions and commentaries about a location for a public audience; andthree, 'self-in-place' broadcasting, in which broadcasters seek to augment their identity (both in thepresent and in the future) by explicitly associating themselves before an audience with a specificlocation. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Social networks; Online social networks; Mobile communication systems; Technology & society; Digital cameras,SocIndex,6,,,,,,,

Is the relative stability of Morocco during Arab Spring due to the so-called Moroccan exception? This paper investigates the relationship between media and political, religious, as well as social values in mobilizing or demobilizing young Moroccans. Using data from the World Values Survey, the political and social climate leading up the Arab Spring is analyzed. Salient questions relating to the role of the Moroccan youth are addressed based on analysis of data. Why are young Moroccans not asking for regime change like the many of their peers in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Syria? Are the nature of their political claims similar or different to the claims of youth in other Arab countries?

The protest attracted hundreds of participants who produced thousands of tweets directed at Moore's Twitter account, grouped under the label #MooreandMe. The protest, guided by Doyle's updates at her blog, garnered widespread media publicity and support from other social justice and feminist activists, raised thousands of dollars for rape survivor nonprofits, and prompted Moore to publicly state on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC news program on December 21 that all rape allegations should be taken seriously, no matter the timing or the person under scrutiny. In this paper I explain why this digital protest was successful and suggest that this campaign exemplifies the unique visibility of the negotiation of goals, tactics, and measures of success in digital protests, as well as highlights aspects of social protest that have previously gone underemphasized. The detailed public record, down to the most minor of interactions, of how the #MooreandMe protest was carried out is a boon to social movements scholars, but also compels them to reexamine their assumptions about the nature and efficacy of protest in a digital age.

While this wealth of new data offers exciting horizons for sociological research, new methods of analysis are required. How can sociologists systematically incorporate digital text into the sociological tool-kit? In this paper I begin by describing how sociologists have handled text data prior to the digitization of text. Next, I describe recent advancements in computational linguistics and the new computational social science. Derived from these techniques, I offer a simple network-based model for analyzing the similarities between texts and locating the emergent themes contained within text-based corpora. I illustrate these techniques in an analysis of United States' presidential inaugural speeches. The digitization of texts represents a possible sea change in how we tell socio-cultural and historical stories. I argue that the greatest potential for these techniques rests at the nexus of new computational methods and more traditional forms of text analysis.

We reason that more mentally rigid individuals should be more averse to dissent and disagreement, thus preferring to interact with others who share their views. Thus, we predict that individuals with ideologies further away from the center should also exhibit greater levels of homophily with respect to political orientation, and that this effect should be stronger on the right. We test our hypotheses on a dataset of 234,042 ego networks belonging to American users of Twitter, which is an online communications network used by over 6% of adult Americans. We find that individuals who follow legislators or think tanks with more ideological or more conservative views tend to be connected with one another at higher rates than followers of equivalent moderate or liberal political figures and organizations. Prior research on social networks leads us to believe that these asymmetries in network composition could in turn give rise to important differences in exposure to political information and success in mobilizing collective action.

We are documenting the world in new ways: the ubiquity of cameras, always in our pockets and ready to upload; status updates on Facebook and Twitter; geographic check-ins that document digitally our physical location; and much more. I tackle this issue by taking on four tasks. (1) I conceptualize what a digital document is and outline contemporary examples. I argue that the digital document is an atomization of life into the consumable. (2) I ask why we document and conclude that we do so in order to exist. (3) I look into how we use documentation technologies and argue that self-documentation is like a fan dance: a game of reveal and conceal. The document is always part fact and part fiction. (4) Finally, I use these insights to build an argument about how experience is changed when filtered through our constant awareness of its potential documentation. I argue that to some degree the document is not simply the reflection of experience, but instead, experience is being driven and changed by its potential documentation.

The shift from a top-down, provider-generated Web 1.0 towards the bottom-up user-generated Web 2.0 is a trend towards unpredictability, incalculability, inefficiency and less subject to external control; a deMcDonaldization of the Web. These conclusions stem from an analysis of Web 2.0, such as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), media sharing sites (e.g., Flickr, YouTube), open source software (e.g., Linux, Firefox), Wikipedia, blogs and the blogosphere (including Twitter) and so on. It is argued here that the mechanism that allows the trend towards deMcDonaldization is the relative lack of scarcity in digital and user-generated environment as compared to the material world that the concept was created to describe. However, this argument is tempered by the fact that much of the Internet is highly rationalized. Many of the sites that allow for unpredictable user-generated content do so precisely because of their rationalized and standardized, thus McDonaldized, underlying structure. For example, Facebook, eBay and Wikipedia pages look and behave similarly for all users. Thus the conclusion is nuanced: that rationality and irrationality can comfortably coexist online, arguably due to the relative lack of scarcity. This conclusion, born out of abundance, is not possible under the McDonaldization thesis that was centered in a material world of scarcity.

In this article, we turn our attention to the production of addiction on the microblogging social media platform, Twitter, as an important emerging site in which the addicting of contemporary societies is also occurring. Our analysis explores two questions. First, we investigate the ways in which addiction is enacted via Twitter. How is addiction being made on Twitter? Second, we ask how the technology of Twitter itself is shaping meaning: how do the technological “affordances” of Twitter help constitute the kinds of addiction being materialized? While we find a multiplicity of meanings in the 140-character messages, we also find a pattern: a tendency toward extremes—addiction riven between pain and pleasure. In addition, we find significant areas of commonality between approaches and notable silences around alternatives to common understandings of addiction. We argue that the constraints on communication imposed by Twitter technology afford a “shorthand” of addiction that is both revealing and productive. Illuminated is the importance of addiction as a piece of cultural shorthand that draws on and simultaneously reproduces simplistic, reductive addiction objects. In concluding, we consider what these realities of addiction being enacted through Twitter can tell us about contemporary conditions of possibility for drug use in society and for individual subjectivities and experiences.

In this essay, we explore the generic tensions that arise when murder mystery intersects with socioeconomic criticism in our age of advanced capitalism. We argue that Les Écœurés functions differently when read through a sociological prism than it does as a noir or polar. We demonstrate that analysis of social media data shows that Delteil captures quite well and to a large extent reproduces the concerns of the Gilets Jaunes movement, while at the same time showcasing the dispiriting durability of a corrupt establishment. Second, on the level of character, we maintain that in presenting a drably failed bildungsroman, the novel undercuts the importance of any individual agency or élan. And third, we argue that on the level of genre, the text—by sidelining its own murder mystery—raises questions about the force and relevance of crime fiction as a potential agent of social change. Ultimately, we maintain that the very failures in and of Les Écœurés point metatextually to the novel's position as an artifact of the period and as embodiment of the Gilets Jaunes movement's likely fate.

In many instances, his rambling verbiage makes him impossible to understand. But even when he is relatively clear his bombast and fulminations take away any credence that can be given to his voice. This usually requires clarifications and reinterpretations by his advisors and cabinet. When Trump, exercising the formal functions of the presidency, attempts to communicate with government institutions his messages are absorbed by them to suit their interests, or he is simply ignored. The original design of American government has provided ramparts against a president like Trump and his diatribes. Also, the fact that this president has been largely unable to fill positions at the highest levels of government makes it all the more difficult for him to communicate to them. The traditional media, respecting professional standards, also resist what he tries to say. Polls show that the public is also skeptical of his voice, especially when it is relayed by Twitter. The general skepticism given to him is no doubt due to the nature of his character and behavior. But Trump is indeed heard by his hardcore base when his meaning, frequently veiled, reinforces the current cultural divide in the United States. This divide can be interpreted as the contemporary sharp schism in the American “civil religion”—the sacred dimension of political and social values. It can be questioned if today's political discourse is any more vitriolic than in the American past.

This role becomes of enhanced importance for marginalized populations as they face a compounded threat due to preexisting social inequalities and exclusion. This study focuses on the utilization of Twitter by ultra-Orthodox journalists during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. The study applies a thematic analysis of 23,110 tweets from the 20 most popular ultra-Orthodox journalists on Twitter. Findings reveal that ultra-Orthodox journalists utilized Twitter in an ""ambassadorial"" role to advocate their community's security through six strategies: (1) explaining the challenges endangering ultra-Orthodox Jews during COVID-19, (2) dispelling COVID-19 accusations directed against ultra-Orthodox Jews, (3) encouraging social distancing and health guidelines, (4) highlighting the social contributions of ultra-Orthodox Jews to the general public during the pandemic, (5) criticizing wrongdoers who violated the health guidelines, and (6) calling out acts of hatred and bigotry that have been directed toward ultra-Orthodox Jews. These findings reveal the professional ethos of ultra-Orthodox journalists and their aspiration to protect their community. Furthermore, these findings shed light on the vital role Twitter can play in journalistic work through inter-social interactivity and the enablement of capabilities, particularly the capability ""to be secure."" Lastly, this study expands the understanding of the social media resource contributing to policymakers tasked with formulating its fair distribution in society in accordance with the capabilities approach and its objective of promoting well-being.

This article examines SNS as a uniquely situated manifestation of COVID-19, and draws attention to the various affordances engendered by SNS for Jewish gathering, learning, and exchange. It draws upon interviews with members of the production team, featured participants, and expert informants, as well as viewer responses from Twitter and YouTube: a dataset that includes 2000 tweets and over 1800 YouTube comments. Collectively, these data suggest that cultural arts productions such as SNS have afforded an expansive network of online Jewish conversations during COVID-19, and have invited a broad audience of Jews and non-Jews into dialogue over Jewish themes and content.

Restorative justice seeks to bring together stakeholders to resolve conflicts and build relationships rather than respond to student misbehaviour through punitive approaches. However, restorative justice practitioners and school authorities are grappling with how to address school conflict that arises online. This conceptual paper proposes virtualizing restorative justice practices as a means of engaging more effectively with youth aggression online as well as provide an additional tool to restorative justice practitioners given the time and resource constraints they operate under. By incorporating elements of restorative justice values and principles in responding to online aggression, this proposed online solution aims to mediate and resolve conflict between users, and empower youth participation all with the advantages of connectivity and persistence of social media platforms. We propose a real-time, innovative solution to an issue that is rampantly growing, furthermore bridging the digital divide between adults and students and forming the building blocks for future pilot testing of such an online solution for school districts nationally.
