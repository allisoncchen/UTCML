On relatively new and highly interactive social networking sites (SNS) that are popular with youth, tools for measuring youth exposure to alcohol marketing in traditional media are inadequate. We critically review the existing policies of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube designed to keep branded alcohol content away from underage youth. Looking at brand and user activity on Facebook for the 15 alcohol brands most popular among US youth, we found activity has grown dramatically in the past 3 years, and underage users may be accounting for some of this activity. Surveys of youth and adult participation in alcohol marketing on SNS will be needed to inform debate over these marketing practices.

Evaluate whether the proportion of Twitter users on a block at a given time who are local residents, inter-metro commuters, or tourists is correlated with incidences of public violence and private conflict for four different time periods: weekday days, weekday nights, weekend days, and weekend nights. Methods: DBSCAN* machine learning technique is used to estimate the home clusters of 54,249 Twitter users who sent at least one geotagged tweet in Boston. Public violence and private conflict are measured using geocoded 911 dispatches. ANOVA models are used to evaluate how the presence of our three groups of interests varies across three types of block-level land usage. Hierarchical linear regression models are used to evaluate whether the proportion of commuters and tourists at census tract- and block-levels are predictive of crime events across the four time periods of interest. Results: We find evidence that Twitter data has limited reliability across residential blocks due to data sparseness. For non-residential blocks, we find that commuter and tourist presence at the block-level are positively associated with both public violence and private conflict, but that these effects are not stable across time periods. Commuters and tourists only effect violence during weekday days, and the effects of commuters and tourists on private conflict are only statistically significant during weekday days and weekend days. Conclusions: Consistent with routine activities and crime pattern theories, the influx of outsiders in a given location impacts the likelihood of crime occurring there. While we find that data from Twitter users can be valuable for measuring block-level ambient populations, it appears this is not true for residential blocks. Future research may further consider how the characteristics of Twitter users may inform spatial patterns in crime.

Methods: We used data on hateful Twitter content, and hate incidents and hate crimes/offences recorded by the Metropolitan Police Service in the United Kingdom to analyse this association, using time-series analysis. This study is unique in its use of newly developed technology to undertake big data analysis with recent, disaggregated online and offline hate data. Results: Our study examined the 'everyday' incidents of (online and offline) hate that affect communities throughout the United Kingdom and we found that anti-Islamic hate speech followed rather than preceded Islamophobic hate offline. Conclusions: Our findings likely point to what we have referred to as compound retaliation, which suggests that media and social media dissemination about offline acts of hate compound already tense intergroup hostilities, providing further permission for those to express hatred online. Such a situation represents the compounding of hate and hostility through offline and online networks that are likely to be reinforcing.

The main finding presented in the paper is that the modal tweet generated between December 1, 2015 and October 31, 2016 was an emotional response—an expression of sadness, outrage, or despair—to police brutality and the killings of African Americans. The second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently than they encourage other political behaviors. These findings suggest that the BLM movement is intelligible through both the resource mobilization and new social movement paradigms within social movement studies.

Both network analysis and discourse analysis are used in order to delineate the characteristics of the tropes associated with the hashtag, to identify the existence of populist elements, as well as to scrutinize the linkage of the hashtag with the broader political context. The study shows that some elements of a populist discourse clearly exist (simple and popular discourse, anti-foreigner), while some others are missing (the existence of a leader). Most importantly, the discussion of the other elements (dichotomous views, othering and anti-elite) highlight the need to better conceptualize and contextualize these features to understand the connection between anti-elite (populism) and anti-foreigner discourses (nativism), the impact of tagged tropes such as a hashtag that can poke holes in echo chambers and the distinction between the concepts of anti-elitism and anti-establishment (especially in specific political contexts such as Turkey).

While scholars have examined counterframing and symbolic boundary-work in resistance movements, little is known about impact social media platforms may have on these narratives. Accordingly, in this article, we explore how actors engage in boundary-work and counterframing through the use of social media. Using Twitter posts containing '#IamaRefugee' as our data, we find that activists engaged in different dimensions of boundary-work in opposition to Trump's ban including creating boundaries between the immoral 'them' and moral 'us'; challenging the boundaries between supposedly threatening refugees and the dominant group; and strengthening the bond of those in opposition to Trump's policies and rhetoric by reinforcing the messages of solidarity. We argue that this boundary-work culminated in direct calls for mobilization. The implications of our findings are meaningful to scholarship on refugee studies, social movements, and framing and to those interested in opposing problematic elite framing.

The present study conducted a thematic analysis of a sample of 2035 tweets with the hashtag #MenAreTrash. Comments that expressed support for the hashtag commented on men's engagement in violence and non-violent mistreatment towards women, highlighted the importance of holding men accountable for misconduct, and called attention to defensive reactions to the hashtag itself. Other users critiqued the use of the hashtag, suggesting that the hashtag was ineffective in engaging men as allies in preventing violence against women, criticising users of the hashtag, or minimising the seriousness of men's violence against women. The dialogue highlights the challenges of raising awareness regarding men's perpetration of violence against women while also engaging men as allies in violence prevention efforts.

Sometimes being alone is relaxing and restorative other times it gives way to feelings of loneliness. Researchers conceptually distinguish between solitude, which tends to be viewed more positively, and loneliness, which is more negative. However, it is unclear whether these terms are used differently in everyday language. We sought to compare the emotional content of over 19 million tweets containing the terms solitude and lonely/loneliness. Using a computational linguistics approach, we found that solitude tends to be used in more positive and less emotionally activated (i.e., lower arousal) contexts compared to lonely. We also found that the word alone tends to be used somewhat differently from solitude and lonely. These results have implications both for how we understand different experiences of time alone in general and for what kind of language we should use when discussing these experiences.

The present study investigated how people use interpersonal (i.e., phone calling, texting, video chatting) and masspersonal media (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) for different purposes (i.e., social connection, entertainment, information seeking) during the pandemic. Further, we examined how such mediated communication is associated with users' loneliness and, in turn, satisfaction with life. Results showed that people preferred interpersonal media for social connection and masspersonal media for entertainment and information seeking. The use of interpersonal and masspersonal media and its purpose were associated with users' psychological well-being both positively and negatively. Social use of interpersonal media was associated with decreased loneliness and, in turn, increased satisfaction with life. However, using media for information seeking was associated with increased loneliness and, in turn, decreased satisfaction with life.

Although usage of this inundation metaphor has been widely documented, its potential influence on immigration attitudes has not been assessed empirically. Building from conceptual metaphor theory's claim that abstract ideas can be grounded in simpler, concrete concepts, we hypothesized that using the inundation metaphor to understand immigration contributes to support for a U.S.--Mexico border wall as a figurative means to block immigrants. Accordingly, social media posts supporting a border wall contained more inundation-metaphoric expressions than messages opposing a wall and messages opposing immigration without reference to a wall (Study 1; N = 4,067). Converging experimental tests show, when controlling for political attitudes, exposure to the inundation metaphor increases support for a border wall (Studies 2a and 2b; N = 737). These findings add to the growing body of evidence that political cognition and policy attitudes are partly motivated by metaphoric comparisons to concrete ideas that are irrelevant in a literal sense.

Overall, sentiments toward older adults became significantly less negative over time, being the least negative in April, August, and October, though the score remained below the neutral value throughout the 11 months. Our topic modelling analysis generated four themes: ""The Need to Protect Older Adults"" (41%), ""Vulnerability and Mortality"" (36%), ""Failure of Political Leadership"" (12%), and ""Resilience"" (11%).

We predicted that, of those who experience chronic ostracism (feeling excluded and ignored frequently), people high in need to belong would utilize Twitter to satisfy their unmet belonging needs more than those low in need to belong. Specifically, individuals high in need to belong and chronic ostracism should use Twitter to form and maintain parasocial relationships (one-sided relationships with media figures). Participants (n = 315) completed a survey assessing their chronic ostracism experiences, dispositional need to belong, and Twitter behavior, particularly regarding potential parasocial relationship targets (n = 229). As expected, when participants reported experiencing high rates of chronic ostracism, participants high in need to belong used Twitter more than those low in need to belong, particularly following more parasocial relationship targets. Thus, maintaining parasocial relationships on Twitter may be an effective way to satisfy unmet belonging needs.

Based on the purposive sampling method, it was decided to reach only the people within the scope of the research and hence qualitative interviews was performed with 15 people. The interviewed people consisted of managers responsible for social media activities at the corporate level hospitals. The data obtained from in-depth interviews were analyzed by content analysis. Accordingly, it was found that the social media tools most commonly used by the surveyed participants was Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram respectively, primarily for sharing health-related information and the purpose of advertisement. It was concluded that 26.6% of social media activities at the corporate level are being conducted by the communication department and the social media is mostly being used to share health related information by the hospitals. The survey also found that hospitals had increased recognition as an advantage of social media, but difficulty in deleting comments related to the hospital was found to be a disadvantage. In this research, only the social media activities of the hospitals were discussed with the managers at the institutional level Thus, future studies that evaluate the views of managers, service providers, and service users about social media are required.

Nutrition information conveyed by popular entities through online social networking sites (i.e., social media influencers) has the potential to impact consumer eating behavior through mechanisms of social influence. Little is known about how online communities of food-related social media influencers are structured, which could reveal influencers' opportunities to observe and spread nutrition-related content and information design practices. This study explored patterns of social relationships (social capital, conservation of resources, and homophily) within a network of prominent food bloggers on Twitter (N = 44). Methods. Data on Twitter following/follower relationships and Twitter use (number of tweets, favorited tweets) were collected from bloggers' Twitter profiles. Bloggers represented eight topical subcategories of food blogs (e.g., family cooking, cocktails) and comprised a one-mode social network with directed ties indicating Twitter following/follower relationships. Structural evidence of patterns of social relationships was investigated through social network visualization, centrality measures (indegree/ out-degree centrality, density, reciprocity), and inferential tests. Results. The overall network density of directed ties was 21%, with wide variability in individual blogger centrality across multiple measures. Cocktails, cooking, special diets, and culinary travel bloggers had more dense ties to bloggers in their own subcategories. Within the network, favorited tweets and outreach (Twitter following relationships) were positively associated with popularity (Twitter follower relationships). Conclusions. Food bloggers in this study formed a partially connected network, supporting the conservation of resources framework. Homophily was evident in some, but not all, topical subcategories. Associations among Twitter use, outreach, and popularity generally supported the social capital framework. Future studies should explore influencers' motivations for connecting on social networking sites, and how content and information design practices spread among influencers.

The paper discusses the more deleterious implications of social networking, whilst assuming a deliberately optimistic stance to uncover ways in which the opportunities afforded by online space can be utilised effectively within social work education and practice. Whilst recognising that social networking platforms are transforming constantly, the paper adopts Kaplan's definition of social media as a 'group of internet based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0'. Whilst much of the discussion within the paper relates to Twitter and Facebook, two of the most endemic international social networking platforms, it is also applicable to myriad forms of social networking. The paper begins with a discussion of UK professional conduct cases and explores these both within Klein's concept of splitting and historical attitudes to new technologies. Drawing from emerging research data and other examples, the positive relational practices educed by social media within social work education and practice are emphasised and discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting Forster's plea for connection and recommending that social work embraces the renewed opportunities provided by online networking.

In this paper, I explore how authors use variant spellings stylistically to deploy personae and characterological figures (Agha, 2003), by examining the presence of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) features in a corpus of 15,804 tweets extracted from the timelines of 10 gay British men. I argue that the stylization of AAVE signals the development of a very specific persona—the ""Sassy Queen""—which relies on an essentialized imagining of Black women as ""fierce"" and ""sassy.""

By clustering Twitter users, we find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.

Language insertion as bilingual practice in the process of language shift.,Journal of Sociolinguistics,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=61058083&site=ehost-live,"This article analyzes language insertion as a bilingual communicative practice, applying a functional, speaker-focused approach to the study of sociolinguistics and language contact. The article is based on a study of contact phenomena in a formerly diglossic region in Northern Germany, where the previously spoken language - Low German - is in the process of being replaced by the dominant standard variety, German. It examines regional publications in order to establish the linguistic techniques by which Low German elements are incorporated into the Standard German texts and the communicative purposes that they serve. The paper concludes that in the process of language shift an emblematic repertoire from Low German is created which can be applied into the dominant contact language, German, for specific communicative purposes. Ausgehend von einer funktionalen, sprecherzentrierten soziolinguistischen Herangehensweise werden im folgenden Artikel bilinguale Einfügungen als Form mehrsprachiger kommunikativer Praxis untersucht. Die Studie analysiert Kontaktphänomene in einer vormals diglossischen Region Norddeutschlands, in der die gesprochene Sprache Niederdeutsch zunehmend von der dominanten Kontaktsprache Deutsch ersetzt wird. Im Artikel werden regionale Publikationen untersucht, um die sprachlichen Techniken heraus zu arbeiten, mit denen niederdeutsche Elemente in den Text integriert werden und welche kommunikativen Funktionen mit ihnen verbunden sind. Der Artikel kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass während eines Prozesses von fortschreitendem Sprachverlust ein emblematisches niederdeutsches Repertoire geschaffen wird, das für spezifische Funktionen in die dominante Kontaktsprache Deutsch eingefügt werden kann. [Standard German] In disse Artikel geiht dat um Insprengsels van en Spraak in en anner.

This case study explores how advocates for concussion awareness in football used Twitter to help spread their message during the 2013 Super Bowl. A content analysis of tweets from 92 concussion advocates on the day of the Super Bowl was conducted. Analysis revealed that the advocates used Twitter for (a) linking to football concussion content, (b) Super Bowl game-related commentary, (c) non-concussion or non–Super Bowl related links or messages, (d) linking to non-football concussion content, (e) concussion-related commentary, (f) engagement, and (g) self or website promotion. Results demonstrate that while advocates have a tremendous opportunity to use the agenda-setting possibilities that are afforded through Twitter, concussion advocates did not utilize Twitter in this manner.

A textual analysis, using constant comparative procedures of 465 tweets from 125 NFL players, was conducted. Results revealed that players discussed the case in the following ways: (a) anticipation, (b) disbelief, (c) critiques of the American Justice System, (d) social commentary, (e) condolences and support, (f) responding to fans, and (g) freedom of speech arguments. The results suggest that Twitter is a viable mechanism for African American and other minority athletes to engage in activism and initiate important conversations about social justice issues. Although empowering, this also may create conflict for team personnel and fans who may be uncomfortable with athletes using Twitter to question structures that favor Whiteness.

The feud originated in November 2017, when LaVar's son—University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) player LiAngelo Ball—was detained in Hangzhou, China, for shoplifting along with two of his UCLA teammates. After some tense moments, the three players were released and flown back to the United States. The U.S. President Donald Trump took credit, leading to a prolonged, prickly exchange with LaVar Ball. This article analyzes six major U.S. newspapers and six sports-specific outlets that covered the Trump–Ball feud. First, we identify the predominant frames that appeared in coverage. Second, we track whose views were included in the news and how sourcing inflected the appearance of particular frames. The incident highlights how racialized language—if coded and dog whistled—enters public discussion through the lens of sport. It also highlights the role of social media, especially Twitter, in influencing news production.

In recent years, he has used it to quietly support the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2014, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by police on a Cleveland playground, just miles from where the Cavaliers play and just north of James’s hometown of Akron. James declined to comment on the case, and a Twitter campaign—#NoJusticeNoLeBron—attempted to force his hand. This article examines the role of James as an athlete-activist, identifying four frames embedded in content around James and the Black Lives Matter movement: Brand LeBron; Established Voice, Higher Expectations; Attention, Not Aggression; and Community Versus Protest. We found James is cautious and deliberate in his activism, moderating a message of consideration rather than revolution, contextualized by his brand and ambitions.

We look specifically at Nike’s history of “social responsibility” to situate the N7 initiative, for Indigenous health, within a larger landscape of privatized social justice. Critical discourse analysis was used to unpack Nike’s annual corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. In addition, a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the #DeChief movement, which lobbies against the use of “Native” mascotry, was conducted via the social media platform, Twitter. The authors observed public criticism against Nike’s incongruous business practices in supporting Indigenous health on one hand, and financially benefitting from the sale of harmful Indigenous caricatures on the other.
