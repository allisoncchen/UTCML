While easily accessible, the use of ""public"" posts raises important questions about the ethics of mining, storing, analyzing, and reporting publicly available social media data—especially when gathering sensitive information such as sexual violence disclosures. Online movements including #MeToo and #WhyIDidntReport emerged to shed light on gender-based violence. These movements generate large quantities of data with little consistency and oversight across research groups, disciplines, and review boards on data ethics. With the recent push in social science to publish data to open science databases, the concerns of feminist psychologists and ethical concerns of social media research with survivors have become more salient. In this article, we describe and address these ethical issues by reviewing existing social media sexual assault disclosure research and make concrete recommendations for authors seeking to use social media data. We also seek to address these ethical concerns by noting the work of some feminist researchers, but also by pushing researchers to do more for survivors through a survivor-informed approach to this research in an open science context. We propose four survivor-informed recommendations for research with this vulnerable population: (a) get input from survivors, (b) update ethics review boards, (c) maximize benefits to participants, and (d) utilize study-appropriate datasets with informed consent.

For data scientists, adding demographic variables and comparisons to closed-ended survey responses have the potential to improve interpretations of inferences drawn from social media—for example, through comparisons of online expressions and survey responses, and by assessing associations with offline outcomes like voting. For survey methodologists, adding social media data to surveys allows for rich behavioral measurements, including comparisons of public expressions with attitudes elicited in a structured survey. Here, we evaluate two popular forms of linkages—administrative and survey—focusing on two questions: How does the method of creating a sample of Twitter users affect its behavioral and demographic profile? What are the relative advantages of each of these methods? Our analyses illustrate where and to what extent the sample based on administrative data diverges in demographic and partisan composition from surveyed Twitter users who report being registered to vote. Despite demographic differences, each linkage method results in behaviorally similar samples, especially in activity levels; however, conventionally sized surveys are likely to lack the statistical power to study subgroups and heterogeneity (e.g. comparing conversations of Democrats and Republicans) within even highly salient political topics. We conclude by developing general recommendations for researchers looking to study social media by linking accounts with external benchmark data sources.

This possibility was proposed in early work suggesting that sentiment surrounding the word ""jobs"" on Twitter closely tracked survey measures of consumer confidence. The current study uses knowledge of the processes generating Twitter data to develop and test hypotheses for when social media and survey data might align, and thus when social media processes may reflect survey measures. We expect and find the greatest correspondence when Twitter data were used to predict perceptions of recent societal economic change, rather than the aggregations of pocketbook economic experiences or reports of the state of the economy. In contrast to the concerns many scholars have raised about nonprobability data sources, the results suggest that correspondence between Twitter data and survey data did not depend on how similar Twitter users were to the population. Finally, we find evidence that the correspondences that did emerge were highly variable over time and appeared to be induced in the presence of economic volatility, suggesting that consistent long-scale trends may not be driven by consistent small-scale mechanisms.

The primary purpose of this research is to examine the effect of migrant inflows on online expressions of regional prejudice, which is defined as expressions of antipathy toward migrants. In particular, we examine the dynamics of expressions of regional prejudice on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. Furthermore, we explain online expressions of regional prejudice through the lens of the group-threat and contact theories, and seek potential conditions that facilitate the development of a positive relationship between local residents and migrants. Our findings lend strong support to the group-contact argument that migrant inflows reduce online expressions of regional prejudice in China. The contact effect is larger when migrant inflows are measured in terms of migrant labor and interprovince migrants, who represent China's typical migrants. Furthermore, the contact effect is only observed in relatively small cities, while a small threat effect is observed in mega and super-mega cities where the population-control system is strictly maintained.

We find that when the raw information is accompanied by uncivil commentary (compared to civil or no commentary), respondents express higher levels of positive and lower levels of negative emotions.

To this end, it draws on a study that explored conversational networks of key stakeholders on the SNS, Twitter. Building on insights from the study, the paper unravels interdependent sociotechnical dynamics that reproduce the offline marginality of affected families and operate as barriers to equitable knowledge production. Through its analysis of the dynamics, the paper provides new insights and advances the sparse criminological scholarship on the intersections of AI systems and the delivery of justice.

Researchers have raised concerns over the use of social media data in research (for example, boyd and Crawford, 2012; Housley et al, 2014; Tinati et al, 2014), exploring the ontological and epistemological grounding of the emerging field. We contribute to this debate by drawing on Wittgensteinian philosophy to elucidate hitherto neglected aspects; namely that it is not just social scientists who are in the business of analysing social media, but users themselves. We explore how mainstream social media analytics research (1) overinflates the importance of sociological theories, concepts and methodologies (which do not typically feature in the accounts of social media users), (2) downplays the extent to which social media platforms already exhibit order prior to any sociological accounting of them, and, (3) thereby produces findings which explain social scientific perspectives rather than the phenomena themselves. We reformulate the ontological and epistemological basis of social media analytics research from a Wittgensteinian perspective concerned with what it makes sense to say about social media, as members of society and as researchers studying those members. Such a project aims to explore social media users' language as a practice embedded within the context of social life and online communication. This reflects the everyday use of language as an evolving toolkit for undertaking social interaction, pointing towards an alternative conception of social media analytics.",Big Data; BIG DATA; CRISIS; CHALLENGES; social media analytics; epistemology; TWITTER; ontology; ordinary language philosophy; philosophy of social science; Wittgenstein,WOS,0,,,,,,,

As further indicated in the Latin root absurdus, ""out of tune, uncouth, inappropriate, ridiculous,"" humor in absurd registers plays with that which is out of harmony with both reason and decency. In this article, the authors make an argument for the absurd as a feminist method for tackling heterosexism. Design/methodology/approach: By focusing on the Twitter account ""Men Write Women"" (est. 2019), the rationale of which is to share literary excerpts from male authors describing women's experiences, thoughts and appearances, and which regularly broadens into social theater in the user reactions, the study explores the critical value of absurdity in feminist social media tactics. Findings: The study proposes the absurd as a means of not merely turning things around, or inside out, but disrupting and eschewing the hegemonic logic on offer. While both absurd humor and feminist activism may begin from a site of reactivity and negative evaluation, it need not remain confined to it. Rather, by turning things preposterous, ludicrous and inappropriate, absurd laughter ends up somewhere different. The feminist value of absurd humor has to do with both its critical edge and with the affective lifts and spaces of ambiguity that it allows for. Originality/value: Research on digital feminist activism has largely focused on the affective dynamics of anger. As there are multiple affective responses to sexism, our article foregrounds laughter and ambivalence as a means of claiming space differently in online cultures rife with hate, sexism and misogyny.

Twitter has become particularly popular in research arenas including social work and is being used for fieldwork, knowledge mobilization activities, advocacy, and professional networking. Although there has been some consideration of the benefits and risks of using social media in academia, little has been written from a qualitative social work perspective. Drawing on the example of Twitter, this article redresses this gap in the literature, by exploring how social media is changing the way research is conducted and promoted in relation to (1) measuring scholarly impact via altmetrics; (2) engaging with research participants; (3) networking and making collegial connections; and (4) advocating for social issues in the public realm. As we highlight tensions in each of these four areas, a key concern is how and for whom social media is contributing to the changing meaning of scholarly impact and engagement in research communities. We draw specific attention to how the inequalities that exist in academia writ large may be amplified on social media thus affecting overall engagement and perceived impact for researchers from marginalized social locations (e.g. gender, race, sexual orientation). We conclude by discussing specific implications of using social media in qualitative social work research and provide suggestions for future areas of inquiry.

The consequences of researchers' decisions on the number of coders, the algorithm learning procedure, and the pre-processing steps on the performance of supervised models",Quality & Quantity,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=161607110&site=ehost-live,"Due to the recent advances in natural language processing, social scientists use automatic text classification methods more and more frequently. The article raises the question about how researchers' subjective decisions affect the performance of supervised deep learning models. The aim is to deliver practical advice for researchers concerning: (1) whether it is more efficient to monitor coders' work to ensure a high quality training dataset or have every document coded once and obtain a larger dataset instead; (2) whether lemmatisation improves model performance; (3) if it is better to apply passive learning or active learning approaches; and (4) if the answers are dependent on the models' classification tasks. The models were trained to detect if a tweet is about current affairs or political issues, the tweet's subject matter and the tweet author's stance on this. The study uses a sample of 200,000 manually coded tweets published by Polish political opinion leaders in 2019. The consequences of decisions under different conditions were checked by simulating 52,800 results using the fastText algorithm (DV: F1-score). Linear regression analysis suggests that the researchers' choices not only strongly affect model performance but may also lead, in the worst-case scenario, to a waste of funds.

This study finds that Twitter users upload their tweets to share important messages for the winter storm, such as weather changes and road conditions. Next, some people think that governments use the winter storm to move people's attention from the serious problems in their life to the weather issue. Third, people are highly interested in a temporary school or workplace closing and weather forecast channels in the winter storm week. Fourth, tweets have the most frequent keywords, such as day, ice, and today, which are related to the weather during the winter storm. Lastly, the spatial pattern of the proportion of tweets is differentiated by regions and periods.

While twitter data are becoming widely available to researchers, methods aimed at selecting reliable twitter data are, to our knowledge, not yet available. To overcome this problem, and allow to employ twitter data for descriptive and predictive purposes, in this contribution we propose an effective statistical method that formalises and extends a quality index employed in the context of the evaluation of academic research, the h index, renamed T index. Our proposal will be tested on a list of twitterers described by the Financial Times as 'the top financial tweeters to follow', for the year 2013. Using our methodology we rank these twitterers and provide confidence intervals to decide whether they are significantly different. Moreover through a sentiment analysis, we employ the twitters content to estimate graphical models useful in the context of financial systemic risk. To this aim we focus on the Italian bank system and we show how listed banks are connected on the basis of tweets data.

Drawing on the theoretical framework of the duality of media, this study proposes that the multifaceted communication world that Twitter mediates can be understood as a result of interactions between Twitter users and the structure of Twitter. We collected all Tweets including the hashtag #kpop from November 9, 2011 to February 15, 2012, and then applied the webometric technique to visualize the #kpop Twitter networks across various regions of the world. We examined the use of URLs and hashtags in #kpop Tweets and found that Twitter use varied across regions, forming various communication networks. The results suggest that Twitter's technological design can shape communication patterns as well as structures.

The study is an extension of the Leveraging Internet for Knowledge Sharing model to the new Twitter context. The findings show that the conversations involve the themes of knowledge sharing, nurturing relationship (community), and activism/advocacy/promotion (action). The conversation networks are decentralized, with advocates, healthcare providers, and average individuals being the central participants. Conversations flow most frequently between participants of the same healthcare roles, yet there is a considerable amount of conversations from healthcare providers to average consumers, and from average consumers to media. It is also noted that most conversations are not continuous or reciprocal. The findings and their implications are discussed in relation to the characteristics of communities of practice.

The study quantitatively examined the interrelationship of web ecology among relevant platforms-including online news, blogs, Twitter and Facebook-during election campaigns. In order to quantify the current political situations, this study employed network analysis and the model fitting method with co-occurrence web visibility data of political parties and their leaders in four platforms. The findings demonstrated to what extent web ecologies on four different online platforms during the given election reflect the country's political situation. Comparing network centralizations across platforms, results showed that online news was the least biased media and Twitter was the most biased with the highest centralization scores. Although both the ruling party and the major opposition party-including the leaders of those two parties-had higher degree centrality scores than minor parties and their leaders in all platforms, some distinct features were observed in Twitter and Facebook due to their attributes. In addition, regressions and their residuals confirmed that web ecologies in four platforms, in terms of degree centrality, had been linearly expanded over time and showed their individual characteristics.

The results suggest that corporations have integrated SNS uses, and use SNSs in different ways according to the characteristics and purposes provided by each SNS. In most cases, retailers and communications and transportation companies actively use SNSs and frequently interact with the public. In addition, Facebook was the leading tool for the dialogic feedback loop, as the dialogic interaction index of Facebook was much higher than that of Twitter.

The data were obtained from the Twitter profiles of Korea's national assemblymen and the most influential political figures. We conducted social network techniques including exponential random graph model and a regression method. The results suggest that these politicians employ two different strategies to establish relationships with other politicians on Twitter. One is 'following' other politicians as a social ritual based on dyadic reciprocity, and the other is to 'mention' other politicians as asymmetric political support based on the public popularity of their peers on Twitter.
