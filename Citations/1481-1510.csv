While missing person cases can place strains on police resources, the use of Internet technology can attenuate some of the demands by aiding with the investigations. As a result, this exploratory study examines one social media tool, Twitter, for missing person investigations by police in Canada. Through logistic regression, we analyze 373 missing person tweets posted over two years (2017–2019) from 15 Canadian police services on Twitter to estimate which features are likely to increase public engagement (retweets, likes, and comments) with these tweets. Results reveal that there are several features significantly associated with higher engagement, such as images and hashtags, ergo increasing community outreach and participation, as well as the likelihood of efficiently and successfully solving these cases. Therefore, we suggest that having standardized components to missing person tweets will enhance the usefulness of this tool.

Social media is recommended as one way to improve community relationships, but is the social media content posted by police departments community-oriented? Is that the type of content they wish to project? By integrating organizational image construction from communication studies with the study of policing, this research compares what municipal police departments intend to convey on social media with the content that they post. Managers of social media accounts emphasized the value of providing transparency and humanizing officers while social media content reveals efforts to delicately balance crime-fighting and community-oriented identities. This balance varies by agency size, jurisdiction, and platform, suggesting that the pressures governing image-making activities must be further examined in local context.

These people are often vulnerable, and their safe and early return is a key factor in preventing them from coming to serious harm. One approach to quickly find missing people is to disseminate appeals for information using social media. Yet despite the popularity of twitter-based missing person appeals, presently little is known about how to best construct these messages to ensure they are shared widely. This paper aims to build an evidence-base for understanding how police accounts tweet appeals for information about missing persons, and how the public engage with these tweets by sharing them. We analyse 1008 Tweets made by Greater Manchester Police between the period of 2011 and 2018 in order to investigate what features of the tweet, the twitter account, and the missing person are associated with levels of retweeting. We find that tweets with different choice of image, wording, sentiment, and hashtags vary in how much they are retweeted. Tweets that use custody images have lower retweets than Tweets with regular photos, while tweets asking the question 'have you seen ... ?' and asking explicitly to be retweeted have more engagement in the form of retweets. These results highlight the need for conscientious, evidence-based crafting of missing appeals, and pave the way for further research into the causal mechanisms behind what affects engagement, to develop guidance for police forces worldwide.

In recent years, various types of new social networking sites have become important tools for police departments. For example, social networking sites have been used to help solve crimes and communicate directly with the public circumventing the traditional news media. At the same time, the public can more easily communicate directly with, or about, the police. This article examines the use of Twitter by police departments on an everyday basis. Drawing on a content analysis of Canadian police departments' Twitter accounts, this article discusses the types of information sent out to the public (i.e. on crimes/investigations, police work, safety/traffic, and community) as well as police attempts to interact with citizens (i.e. through invitations to attend events, asking for responses, and responding to and/or mentioning others). The findings suggest that Twitter was used to help manage the image of the police and build community. The implications of these findings are also discussed.

Drawing on a combination of interviews, focus groups, policy documents, and social media data, this article explores the NPS's motivations and goals in using social media. It also highlights many of the challenges they have faced in implementing their strategy. The research finds that while the use of social media in policing aims to decentralise police communication efforts, in Kenya is has recentralized them. Furthermore, instead of reforming the way the police and public interact, it often serves to reinforce existing practices. While social media does not yet seem to be revolutionising the way the police engage with the public in Kenya, there are indications that the public is receptive to police social media accounts. In an environment where there is little trust in the police, this openness to engagement is considered an encouraging achievement within the NPS.

The internet hashtag movement emerged from quality investigative journalism, and the movement has done what the law could not (MacKinnon 2018). Examining tweets that include the English version of the hashtag, Lee and Murdie (2020) found that women are more likely to engage in #MeToo in countries where their political rights are better protected. This finding, however, does not seem to fit East Asia's experience. The region's earliest and longest democracy, Japan, had a much milder movement than neighboring South Korea. Many South Korean women publicly named their perpetrators, but Japanese women, when sharing their experience of being harassed, mostly remained anonymous (Hasunuma and Shin 2019). Moreover, Taiwan, arguably the most gender-equal country in this region—if measured by women's political representation (42% in the national legislature) or by policies toward sexual minorities (it was the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage)—has had virtually no #MeToo movement.

Four consistent trends were identified across these four contexts, with important implications for the study of social movements, youth activism, gender, sexuality, and race. First, levels of emotional taxation resulting from LGBTQI activist work were consistently very high. Second, emotional burdens were systematically greater for young, nonwhite, and transgender activists. Third, emotional taxation was compounded for activists whose identities crossed multiple marginalized groups. This finding supports the validity and importance of intersectional approaches to LGBTQI issues. Fourth, the sources of emotional taxation varied greatly among activists, and transgender activists were particularly stressed by public engagements such as major events and marches. Transgender nonwhite activists also indicated relatively high levels of emotional stress related to online forms of engagement, such as posting on Twitter and Facebook. These findings could help identify the kinds of activists who participate, the kinds of issues advocated for, and why certain tactics are used.

Initially, scholarship on the personalization of politics focused on what was often called “candidate-centered” voting: the idea that citizens would vote based on a candidate's personality. Many scholars viewed this evaluative approach as irrational and heralded the value of issue stances over charisma (see Fenno 1978; Popkin 1991). Focusing on the personal, it seems, was problematic. Another iteration of the personalization in politics was also problematic and focused on the use of the “personal frame” in news coverage of women candidates. Such news coverage focused more on women's personalities and personal lives as compared to men's (e.g., Bystrom 1999; Devitt 1999). On its surface, such coverage does not appear detrimental. However, this framing would often emphasize women's roles as mothers and wives and use that framing to question women's experience, fitness for office, and whether they could juggle domestic and political responsibilities (Braden 1996). Personalization in both iterations elicited a sense of triviality: voters’ focus on persona was deemed as a trivial way to form an opinion, and women candidates were trivialized via a focus on their personal, not political, lives.

Before the digital revolution, the relationship between the politician and the voter was intermediated by journalists and broadcast media. In contrast to traditional media, social media are presumed to enable politicians to engage directly with the electorate (Kruikemeier, Van Noort, Vliegenthart & De Vreese, 2015). In the last decade, there was a growing interest in the role of social media in election campaigns, triggered by Barack Obama's electoral presidential election victory in 2008 and more recently by Donald Trumps' triumph in 2016 (Rodriguez-Andres, 2018). The research presented in this article answers three main questions. First, who are the politicians using Twitter for campaigning purposes and what variables can predict Twitter use? Second, when do Belgian politicians use it and with which frequency? And third: do tweeting politicians perform better at the ballot box? The main findings reveal that a Flemish candidate has a higher probability of 18,7% to be present on Twitter compared to a candidate from the French community. Another important finding is that there is no significant association between the number of tweets and number of preferential votes, although a trend towards significance was observed for Flemish politicians.

Credibility is essential in this respect. Due to the mediated nature of political communication, citizens base their credibility evaluation on leaders' media presentations and the public debate in the media that develops in response to it. The source credibility approach suggests that leaders are credible if citizens consider them competent, trustworthy, and caring. What remains underexplored is how these evaluations of leaders' source credibility come about and how changes in them can be understood. To this end, we introduce the concept of enacted credibility. Enacted credibility entails the framing and reframing of leaders' credibility in the interaction between political leaders' performance, citizens, and other participants in the public debate in the media. Empirically we explore the relevance of this concept by studying the case of Dutch Social Democratic leader Job Cohen. We found that the interplay among and between participants in the public debate in the media and his media performance is key to understanding the substantial decline in his source credibility during the 2010 parliamentary election campaign. Our analysis shows that some dimensions of credibility became more salient in the public debate in the media than others, impacting the overall evaluation of his source credibility.

Based on the cases of PiS rhetoric on the Smolensk catastrophe, and its narratives on gender and anti-LGBTQ issues, I demonstrate how the latter could be used for political othering and for subverting the core democratic principles. My data includes publications in Polish media and on social platforms (Twitter and Facebook), mostly before and after elections to European and national parliaments in May and October 2019, as well as during the presidential election in spring 2020.

In March 2016, the adult social work Principal Social Worker (PSW) Network ran the first Call to Action in support of the Ministry of Justice Mental Capacity Action Day. The MCA Call to Action was conceived and designed as a critical and creative way to conduct practice-led research into the integration into social work values of the statutory principles within the MCA 2005. The approach made use of the open social media platform, twitter. Thematic analysis was undertaken of the content generated during the Call to Action. Secondary social network analysis was undertaken to map the relationships and exchanges which took place during the MCA Call to Action. The findings were that 269 unique users participated in the MCA Call to Action, two-thirds of which self-identified as being social workers during the MCA Call to action. There were 244 media tweets posted during the Call to Action showing an image of anunwise decision, 80% of these were posted by social workers. The role of PSWs and the implications for social work practice leadership are discussed.

Since English and Polish are recognized as representatives of negative and positive politeness cultures, respectively, the analysis was to examine if there are differences in politeness conventions in customer-provider interaction on Twitter. The study found that although similar strategies are used by English and Polish companies in responding to complaints, the frequency of the respective strategies is different. The results of the analysis confirm differences in the use of positive and negative politeness strategies as well as differences in the level of directness in interaction between English and Polish profiles.

Traditional machine learning models may encounter problems when used in such a context, due to the peculiarities of microblogging sites and the manner in which these networks interact (both between themselves and with other networks). Moreover, state-of-the-art approaches have focused on non-transparent techniques that cannot be audited; so, despite the fact that they are top performing techniques, it is impossible to check if the models are actually fair. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised methodology that uses our Discriminatory Expressions algorithm for feature selection to detect expressions that are biased towards extremist content (Francisco and Castro 2020). With the help of human experts, the relevant expressions are filtered and used to retrieve further extremist content in order to iteratively provide a set of relevant and accurate expressions. These discriminatory expressions have been proved to produce less complex models that are easier to comprehend, and thus improve model transparency. In the following, we present close to 70 expressions that were discovered by using this method alongside the validation test of the algorithm in several different contexts.

ISIS also achieve this through publishing propaganda materials, such as the two online magazines Dabiq and Rumiyah (Heidarysafa et al. 2019). In this paper, our focus lies with the former. Through a transitivity analysis of three issues from Dabiq, this paper explores how the in-group (the believers) and the Other (the non-believers) are represented in the magazine. The transitivity framework is useful here because it exposes the linguistic choices that people make and, in turn, reveals how they perceive their world. To retrieve both quantitative and qualitative findings, the UAM Corpus Tool (O'Donnell 2016) is employed.

It is also part of research on the use of Twitter by religious people and the use of social media in the Arab world, and more specifically the current article focuses on the priorities of Arab religious preachers in the Arab-Muslim world in their uses of Twitter. I have chosen a Muslim preacher who has been the owner of the most followed Twitter account in the Arab-Muslim world: Mohamad al-Arefe. At the time of my research, this Saudi Sunni preacher was ranked in the 83rd1 place in the global ranking of the most followed Twitter accounts in the world. This article aims to develop a typology of content shared on Twitter by al-Arefe. This research examines the way the Twitter platform is being used by this preacher, and it answers the question whether the theoretical model of religion mediatisation applies to the content shared by al-Arefe. This article combines two methodological approaches to study the content shared by al-Arefe on his Twitter account: a quantitative method and a qualitative one. I focus on the analysis of three elements present among the contents shared by this preacher on his Twitter account: Hashtags, visuals and links. Finally, my analysis shows how al-Arefe focuses more on his person and his image than he focuses on presenting Islamic teachings.
