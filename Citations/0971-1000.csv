973,journalArticle,2014.0,"Zimbardo, Zara",Cultural Politics of Humor in (De)Normalizing Islamophobic Stereotypes.,Islamophobia Studies Journal,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=117131960&site=ehost-live,"This paper offers an examination of the role of humor in both normalizing Islamophobic representations as Other and in creatively challenging them. The first section traces historic connections of ways dominant culture in the United States portrays targeted groups as both full of irrational anger and lacking a sense of humor or the ability to ""get"" or ""take"" jokes. In the perpetuation of dehumanizing stereotypes, this discourse of negation undermines core aspects of being seen as fully human, as humor is a fundamental communication realm of bonding and generating shared symbolic and social meaning within different cultural contexts. Against this backdrop, the more specific level of denial of humor functions to dismiss socio-political causes for anger at injustice, discrimination and violence, pathologizing the targeted group for not being able to share laughter at jokes that normalize their oppression. This power dynamic serves to invisibilize context, psychologize structural issues, and delegitimize resistance. The following sections turn to uses of humor and political comedy to strategically surface, explicitly challenge and subvert Islamophobic stereotypes since the start of the War on Terror. From the Axis of Evil Comedy troupe, to The Daily Show's satirical Muslim version of The Cosby Show to the recent appropriation of Newsweek's ""Muslim Rage"" cover and the subsequent mocking transformation through social media that followed attaching a wide range of hilarious humanizing images and tweets to the #MuslimRage hashtag, diverse comic strategies have worked to expose dehumanizing stereotypes in a time of war and made them ""uninhabitable."" By holding up mirrors to mainstream narratives of the monolithic Muslim Other, both Muslims and non-Muslim allies have used techniques of humor to create punchlines that open shared understandings of the underlying assumptions of dominant frames, and destabilize them through making those assumptions visible, and laughable. Drawing from cultural studies, humor studies and media studies, this paper incorporates scholarship on audience response, popular culture, theories of humor, and interviews.

Launched in November 2014 by the Italian collective Wu Ming, #Renziscappa aimed to encourage the reporting online of any form of offline protest against the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The implementation of #Renziscappa by Wu Ming and their followers sought to counter mainstream representations of Renzi's purported consensus, and to catalyze and organize the offline protests. Conversely, offline participation linked the hashtag to impact-making political actions. However, the uncontrolled proliferation of #Renziscappa and its appropriation by the Movimento 5 Stelle made the online campaign increasingly lose its connection with the offline protests. By contrast, the concerted transmedia diffusion of #Renziscappa through Wu Ming's blog Giap and interactive maps preserved this connection. In particular, the maps contextualized #Renziscappa in the genealogical evolution, geo-temporal settings, and socio-political composition of the offline movement. The network of these transmedia extensions constituted a narrative alternative to the mainstream that made users perceive the collective dimension of the movement in a national perspective and fostered the formation of a political subjectivity.

This paper characterizes Twitter message content pertaining to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and Naloxone. Methods: In-depth thematic analysis was conducted of 1,010 Twitter messages collected in June 2019. Our primary aim was to identify user perceptions and experiences related to harm reduction (e.g., Naloxone) and MOUD (e.g., sublingual and Extended-release buprenorphine, Extended-release naltrexone, Methadone). Results: Tweets relating to OUD were most commonly authored by general Twitter users (43.8%), private residential or detoxification programs (24.6%), healthcare providers (e.g., physicians, first responders; 4.3%), PWUOs (4.7%) and their caregivers (2.9%). Naloxone was mentioned in 23.8% of posts and authored most commonly by general users (52.9%), public health experts (7.4%), and nonprofit/advocacy organizations (6.6%). Sentiment was mostly positive about Naloxone (73.6%). Commonly mentioned MOUDs in our search consisted of Buprenorphine-naloxone (13.8%), Methadone (5.7%), Extended-release naltrexone (4.1%), and Extended-release buprenorphine (0.01%). Tweets authored by PWUOs (4.7%) most commonly related to factors influencing access to MOUD or adverse events related to MOUD (70.8%), negative or positive experiences with illicit substance use (25%), policies related to expanding access to treatments for OUD (8.3%), and stigma experienced by healthcare providers (8.3%). Conclusion: Twitter is utilized by a diverse array of individuals, including PWUOs, and offers an innovative approach to evaluate experiences and themes related to illicit opioid use, MOUD, and harm reduction.

Methods: One month of unique tweets (n = 26,079) from July 23, 2018 to August 22, 2018 were identified using the keyword ""opioid"" in conjunction with the words ""crisis, epidemic, misuse, prescription, and death."" Twelve topics, each representing more than 1% of all tweets, together accounted for 17,206 (66%) of identified tweets. Results: The top four tweet topics (representing 38% of the total) addressed lawsuits and public policy, people who use opioids to treat persistent pain, programs to alleviate the opioid epidemic, and one specific initiative, the ""#onelesspill"" movement. The next seven topics (representing 27% of the total) addressed news articles relating to the opioid epidemic. The 12th topic was a book about the opioid crisis (1.7% of the total tweets). Conclusions: These tweets exhibited polarization of opinions with some people calling for tighter restrictions on opioids and others desperate to preserve their daily use of opioids for alleviation of illnesses characterized by persistent pain. Social media posts can help inform efforts to craft public policy and communication strategies to support optimal opioid stewardship.

The study was exploratory in nature, with its main objective consisting of inductively identifying topics embedded in user-generated content. We found that a five-topic model was the best in representing the data corpus, including: (i) the public's perception of gambling addiction amid the COVID-19 outbreak, (ii) risks and support available for those who stay at home, (iii) the users' interpretation of gambling addiction, (iv) forms of gambling during the pandemic, and (v) gambling advertising and impact on families. Sentiment analysis showed a prevalence of underlying fear, trust, sadness, and anger, across the corpus. Users viewed the pandemic as a driver of problematic gambling behaviors, possibly exposing unprepared individuals and communities to forms of online gambling, with potential long-term consequences and a significant impact on health systems. Despite the limitations of the study, we hypothesize that enhancing the presence of mental health operators and practitioners treating problem gambling on social media might positively impact public mental health and help prevent health services from being overwhelmed, in times when healthcare resources are limited.

Findings: The usual mechanisms that victims go through to report are curtailed and the lockdown and quarantine presented the perpetrators the perfect environment to continue disrespecting victims, as everyone was required to respect the stay at home orders, hence it gave fertile ground for isolation and control of the victims.

In examining how Nigerian queer males assert their agency, this study pays attention to the linguistic advocacies around the topics of ""coming out"" and ""reaching out"". I analyse how Nigerian queer men navigate the digital media space and engage in anti-homophobic advocacies. The data are retrieved from Twitter via keyword searches and manually selected tweets. Using located and embedded knowledge, I identify that the performative use of language achieves the functions of coming out and confronting homophobic cyberbullying; providing information to non-queers; representations of family and acceptance in queer tweets; and, speaking out against politicians, government and society. The implications are that queer Nigerian males identify and use digital platforms for expressing their sexualities as well as for purposive identity formations which manifest in both in- and out-group advocacies.

Racialized canine invective played a formative role in colonial efforts to dispossess Africans of land. However, the symbolic meanings of dogs in South African culture range far beyond insult. Recent portrayals of canines have turned suggestively, if equivocally, from denigration toward signalling post-apartheid racial authenticity. To reflect on this shift, I draw on academic and popular writing about dog–human relations in South Africa, among them political discourse, popular media, tweets and the use of 'animal likenesses' in the essay 'The Year of the Dog' by Njabulo Ndebele, the novel Disgrace by J. M. Coetzee, and a series of photographs of Africanis dogs by the artist Daniel Naudé. Through this examination, I consider the ambivalent emblem of the dog beyond the framework of either abuse or authenticity, to consider it as a barometer of critical shifts in notions of race in South African culture.

The literary works and online presence in public discourses of writers labelled Afropolitan show that they challenge and revise the present world order in the way that Walter Mignolo and other theorists of decoloniality envisage in their concept of ‘critical cosmopolitanism’. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Teju Cole, for example, implement Afropolitanism as a critical assessment of global culture that defies a reduction of the concept simply to its commercial dimension.

Seven major themes emerged: internal reactions, expectations of negative social reactions, perpetrator factors, myths and knowledge, actual negative reactions from others, protection of others, and concerns about evidence. These themes are largely consistent with more narrowly focused past research, suggesting that social media may continue to offer viable opportunities for unobtrusive research in the future.

Applying a state-of-the-art deep learning technique (i.e., the fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT] algorithm), the current study extracted the public's daily emotion associated with working from home (WFH) at the U.S. state level over four months (March 01, 2020-July 01, 2020) from 1.56 million tweets. We then applied discontinuous growth modeling (DGM) to investigate how COVID-19 and resultant stay-at-home orders changed the trajectories of the public's emotions associated with WFH. Our results indicated that stay-at-home orders demonstrated both immediate (i.e., intercept change) and longitudinal (i.e., slope change) effects on the public's emotion trajectories. Daily new COVID-19 case counts did not significantly change the emotion trajectories. We discuss theoretical implications for testing EST with the global pandemic and practical implications. We also make Python and R codes for fine-tuning BERT models and DGM analyses open source so that future researchers can adapt and apply the codes in their own studies.

A content analysis and effects of structure on recruiter judgments and predictive validity.,Journal of Applied Psychology,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=148494595&site=ehost-live,"Many organizational representatives review social media (SM) information (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) when recruiting and assessing job applicants. Despite this, very little empirical data exist concerning the SM information available to organizations or whether assessments of such information are a valid predictor of work outcomes. This multistudy investigation examines several critical issues in this emerging area. In Study 1, we conducted a content analysis of job seekers' Facebook sites (n = 266) and found that these sites often provide demographic variables that U.S. employment laws typically prohibit organizations from using when making personnel decisions (e.g., age, ethnicity, and religion), as well as other personal information that is not work-related (e.g., sexual orientation, marital status). In Study 2 (n = 140), we examined whether job seekers' SM information is related to recruiter evaluations. Results revealed that various types of SM information correlated with recruiter judgments of hireability, including demographic variables (e.g., gender, marital status), variables organizations routinely assess (e.g., education, training, and skills), and variables that may be a concern to organizations (e.g., profanity, sexual behavior). In Study 3 (n = 81), we examined whether structuring SM assessments (e.g., via rater training) affects criterion-related validity. Results showed that structuring SM assessments did not appear to improve the prediction of future job performance or withdrawal intentions. Overall, the present findings suggest that organizations should be cautious about assessing SM information during the staffing process. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

Despite being widely used, qualitative training reactions are poorly understood. Recent trends suggest commenting is ubiquitous (e.g., tweets, texting, Facebook posts) and points to a currently untapped resource for understanding training reactions. In order to enhance the interpretation and use of this rich data source, this study explored commenting behavior and investigated 3 broad questions: who comments, under what conditions, and how do trainees comment? We explore both individual difference and contextual influences on commenting and characteristics of comments in 3 studies. Using multilevel modeling, we identified significant class-level variance in commenting in each of the 3 samples of trainees. Because commenting has only been considered at the individual level, our findings provide an important contribution to the literature. The shared experience of being in the same class appears to influence commenting in addition to individual differences, such as interest in the topic (Studies 1 and 2), satisfaction (Studies 2 and 3), and entity beliefs (Study 3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that item wording may have an impact on commenting (Study 3) and should be considered as a potential lever for training professionals to influence commenting behavior from trainees. Training professionals, particularly those who regularly administer training evaluation surveys, should be aware of nonresponse to open-ended items and how that may impact the information they collect, use, and present within their organizations.

In Study 1, 184,805 adoption profiles from Petfinder indicated how long a pet will remain online and unadopted. Consistent with evidence from related persuasion settings such as peer‐to‐peer lending, pets spent less time online if profile writers had an analytic thinking style and advertisements contained few peripheral processing cues such as social words. Study 2 (N = 676,004 adoption profiles) replicated Study 1 patterns and found that adopted pet profiles contained more markers of analytic thinking and fewer social words than unadopted pet profiles. In an experiment (Study 3, N = 987), participants read an adoption advertisement typical of adopted or unadopted pets. Participants self‐reported that they would be more likely to adopt a pet and visit its shelter after reading a more analytic and less social adoption profile (indicators of adopted pets) than a less analytic and more social profile (indicators of unadopted pets). Finally, Study 4 (N = 3,245 Tweets) demonstrated that more analytic and less social word patterns relate to increased engagement online, such as likes and retweets. These data suggest pet adoption that begins online is a social and psychological process, enhanced by messages with markers of complex thinking and few humanizing references. Advances to persuasion theory are discussed, underscored by the implications for pet adoption and how language patterns in online advertisements can reflect influence at scale.

The advent of social media has resulted in this information spreading quicker then ever before, and in qualitatively different ways, since people no longer need to be in face-to-face contact or even know each other to pass on information in an crisis situation. Social media also provides a wealth of data about this information diffusion since much of the communication happening within this platform is publicly viewable. This data trove provides researchers with unique information that can be examined and modeled in order to understand urgent diffusion. A robust model of urgent diffusion on social media would be useful to any stakeholders who are interested in responding to a crisis situation. In this paper, we present two models, grounded in social theory, that provide insight into urgent diffusion dynamics on social networks using agent-based modeling. We then explore data collected from Twitter during four major urgent diffusion events including: (1) the capture of Osama Bin Laden, (2) Hurricane Irene, (3) Hurricane Sandy, and (4) Election Night 2012. We illustrate the diffusion of information during these events using network visualization techniques, showing that there appear to be differences. After that, we fit the agent-based models to the observed empirical data. The results show that the models fit qualitatively similarly, but the diffusion patterns of these events are indeed quite different from each other.

This study examines undergraduate students’ use of SNSs and online privacy preferences. Eighty-five students in social work classes were surveyed to determine the frequency of SNS access and privacy control usage. Student participants accessed SNSs (97.6%) more than the general population (72%) surveyed by the Pew Research Internet Project (Brenner & Smith, 2013). Most students restricted access to their profiles through friends-only privacy settings and took steps to eliminate unwanted posts. However, regrets over personal posts were still commonplace. The 2005 National Association of Social Workers and Association of Social Work Boards ethical standards suggest establishing professional boundaries and safeguarding personal information as part of technologically proficient practice. Social work educational programs should provide training on privacy risk management to protect students from unwanted and potentially career damaging disclosures on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and other Internet sites.
