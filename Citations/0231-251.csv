231,journalArticle,2020.0,"Rafeeq, Ali; Jiang, Shujun; Feng, Guangchao Charles",Breaking news of disasters: How Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz used Facebook and Twitter in the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake coverage in New Zealand.,Cogent Social Sciences,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=148040777&site=ehost-live,"This study looks at how media users reacted and engaged with Facebook and Twitter posts of two major New Zealand news websites—Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz—during the coverage of the 7.8 magnitude Kaikoura earthquake in November 2016. Using posts (n = 975) on Facebook pages and tweets (n = 889) on Twitter handles of Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz from 12 November to 17 November, we analysed how media users reacted to breaking news coverage of a major natural disaster. The results show that quake news gets significantly more interaction and reactions than non-quake news on both social media platforms. For Twitter, quake news gets significantly more interactions such as likes, and retweets, but not replies. However, for Facebook, quake news gets significantly more comments, likes, wows, and sad emotional feedbacks, but no significant difference in emotions such as love, haha, and angry. The emotions people have on Facebook indicate well the nature of the news. With Facebook's new function of reactions including, like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry, makes reactions more expressive and relevant. The study also shows a clear pattern of reactions on the two social media platforms across the timeline. While the number of posts keeps stable over the period, users' reactions soared in the first two days of the quake; The responses subsided after the chaotic period of the disaster was over. The study provides an insight into how mainstream news websites are using social media in reporting and engaging with users during major natural disasters. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also discussed.

Alternative communications spaces have revolutionised political communication in Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, political polarisation has created a monolithic voice in the mainstream media. In the ""Second Republic"", digital activism is a growing phenomenon where subalterns question the state. This study is guided by Manuel Castells' Power and Counter Power Theory. Data gathered using netnography was analysed using critical discourse analysis. Findings show that digital activism has turned into social media ""dissidence"", calling for the resignation of the government officials including the Executive through 31st demonstrations. There is an intimate relationship between digital democracy and digital activism, enabling political advocacy and lobbying. Twitter is used to safeguard the lives of activists. Religious discourses were used by both Jacob Ngarivhume and Hopewell Chin'ono as they drummed up support for the July 31st demonstrations.

Tweet content is considered using a framework from prior court cases: does a tweet constitute political speech; contribute to the marketplace of ideas; encourage violence or include threats? The results show that messages of hate can be communicated without using overly offensive words; and that Twitter users discuss who should vs. should not use a word. Study findings are considered in the context of the U.S. having become more divided politically, and social media's role in amplifying racists' messaging.

We discuss how the sharing and communication of messages through hashtags on Twitter facilitate the perception of the hashtag as a cultural object that activates a political agenda and perpetuates a digital social movement. This study used a novel approach to explore the significance of the echo chamber of emotions involved in digital protests and introduced stages of digital activism. The paper concludes by arguing that during a protest, the activists employ emotions as self-expressive tools that help them connect the issue at hand to bigger societal issues (structural discrimination and inequalities) and metaphors (prison and criminal behavior). Once this process starts, it further paves the way to reaching out for support, encouraging action from others, and demanding change from the government, as we show via the digital activism framework.

Twitter accounts for 25 elite American universities were examined for political and religious sentiment and then compared to results from 25 lower ranked schools. The aim was to examine the extent universities post politically liberal or anti-Christian messaging through Twitter. Results suggest elite universities promote more liberal messages than conservative or Republican messages and more liberal messages than lower ranked schools. Overall, the sample of schools made few tweets containing pro-Christianity messaging despite some of the schools having strong connections to Christian denominations or having been founded as religious institutions to train Christian clergy. The findings add additional insight as to why discussions on scientific issues may be influenced by political partisanship.

The crisis of truth refers to an era where evidence and objective facts get lost in sentiment, emotion, and personal beliefs. Relying on emotions, creationism, religious beliefs, and common sense over expertise deliberately creates counter-knowledge referred to as pseudo-science, troll-science or fake-science. As the worth of scientific expertise is devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through populist political rhetoric help to produce a culture of resistance to science. Our qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts along with the news regarding anti-vaccine arguments from two selected online news sites, revealed three major themes, which we referred to as strategies used by the COVID-19 vaccine deniers in Turkey to disseminate their views. These were: an emphasis on bodily freedom and personal choice and the use of ""my body my choice"" rhetoric; the denying, devaluing, and shifting of scientific evidence; and the dismissal and/or attacking of alternative views and the deepening of the polarisation between the supporters of the COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine supporters and deniers. We conclude the paper by arguing that there is a link between the distrust of doctors and the anti-vaccination ideas, and the quest for alternative knowledge and expert authority.

Researchers have highlighted distinguishing features of social media network platforms: network structure transparency, public self-monitored digital profiles, homogenized network connections, and node-created digital content. These features, while adding utility to social media platform providers and users, can also be exploited to manipulate users' behavior and overall network outcomes. This paper posits the importance of network theory as critical foundational ""laws"" upon which the responsible innovation of social media can be built to minimize such manipulation, how such theory can be used to predict the potential impacts of new network innovations, and the resulting difficulty this framing suggests for self-governance on the part of platform providers. Through a case study analysis of Russian social media interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the value of a network theoretic lens is highlighted. The concept of ""supranodes"", social media nodes empowered via theoretical knowledge and network awareness to socially engineer network structures and outcomes, is developed and the network theoretic features they exploit discussed.

This study analyzes patients' opinions of the online communication strategies of hospitals in Spain. Therefore, a mixed-method is proposed. Firstly, a qualitative analysis through a focus-group was carried out, so around twenty representatives of national, regional and local patients' associations were brought together. Secondly, the research is supplemented with a content assessment of the Twitter activity of the most influential hospitals in Spain. The results reveal that the general public appreciate hospitals' communication potential through social media, although they are generally unaware of how it works. The group says that, apart from the lack of interaction, they find it hard to understand certain messages, and some publications give a biased picture. In order to improve communication, patients and relatives are demanding that their perspective be taken into consideration in the messages issued to enhance the quality of life and well-being of society.

In what appears to be the start of a regional trend, several East African nations have imposed taxes and fees on social media. Uganda has levied the world's first tax on social media users, imposing in 2018 a daily tax on the use of fiftyeight websites and applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Skype. To access these platforms, one must pay a daily fee of 200 Ugandan Shillings ($.054 USD). This Note will use the Ugandan social media tax as a case study through which to examine the legality, under international law, of financial burdens designed to suppress political dissent. While the analysis will focus solely on Uganda's law, much of it will apply beyond Uganda's borders to countries pursuing similar legislation. Part I provides important background with respect to the Ugandan scheme. Part II explores freedom of expression over the Internet under international law and determines what types of restrictions on expression are legally permissible. Part III analyzes whether a tax that affects speech would be considered a restriction of expression. Finally, Part IV examines the social media tax through the lens of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and analyzes the consequences of a determination that the social media tax violates international norms, both within Uganda and more broadly across East Africa.

While immigrant advocates were quick to explain the myriad constitutional problems with this proposal, elements of Trump's dream are already a reality. This Article reveals how a single Customs and Border Protection officer can short-circuit the checks and balances prescribed by U.S. and international law to protect refugees from being returned to harm, and cast a long shadow over a future, meritorious asylum claim. In light of the growing attention to the plight of those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum at our borders, this Article examines shortcomings in both law and practice, illuminating the long-lasting ramifications of erroneously issued expedited removal orders for asylum seekers and their families. Congress designed the expedited removal system to expedite deportations and circumvent due process before an immigration judge. Certain humanitarian protections are built into the system to ensure that the United States meets its international and domestic legal obligations not to return refugees to a place where they would face persecution or torture. In practice, these humanitarian protections are too often improperly implemented and front-line border enforcement officials, whether manifesting bias against asylum seekers or lacking proper training and expertise, routinely ignore U.S. law and the Department of Homeland Security's own regulations. This results in the wrongful deportation of asylum seekers and, as revealed in the Article, in permanent negative ramifications for those lucky enough to make it back over the border to in an attempt to re-apply for asylum. The Article examines the disastrous interplay between two of the ""speed deportation"" processes of expedited removal and reinstatement of removal, the lack of sufficient safeguards that leave refugee screening at our borders in the shadows, and the absence of judicial review. The Article seeks not only to expose and analyze this problem, but also to improve the situation by considering a suite of pragmatic, actionable solutions to close the gap between the humanitarian protections prescribed by law and the reality faced by asylum seekers at the U.S. border. As an immediate first step to implement the humanitarian protections enshrined in law, the Article explores the merits and risks of using readily available technology: the use of Body-Worn Cameras by Customs and Border Protection officers conducting screenings of potential refugees at the border to fill the protection gap.

This litigation is an illuminating example of why First Amendment analysis must extend to government social media pages, and yet raises new challenges. There are logical reasons why government actors may want to exert certain controls over their social media pages, though these controls will potentially run against the First Amendment. As such, this Note not only argues why First Amendment analysis must extend to government use of social media, but also proposes methods for how government actors might structure their online presences to avoid First Amendment rebuke.

This included the creation of the hashtag #12DaysofRage. In this article, I explore how Cho used her status as a celebrity to circulate #12DaysofRage which acted as a discursive intervention in rape culture. I used content analysis and thematic analysis to identify themes in the archive of 2401 tweets I collected. I also performed a feminist discourse analysis on both the tweets and news coverage of the campaign to situate the hashtag within its historical, social, and political context. I argue that Cho performed what I call “promotional activism”, a subsection of celebrity activism where a celebrity promotes a cause as part of the promotion of a particular project or product. Cho’s choice to centre herself in the campaign made it impossible to separate Cho from the hashtag, preventing #12DaysofRage from greater viral potential, but still acting as a resonant, but ephemeral, gathering point for survivor-focused advocacy.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,
