Based on NodeXL, Tweets with the hashtag 'Kpop' were collected from March to August 2012 and the structural and informational patterns of social media communication were analyzed through a set of webometric methods. The results indicate that Kpop won a small but growing portion of the music preferences in Hispanic countries as a result of combined efforts of public broadcast firms and fans. The study is the first to focus on countries sharing a common language to provide a better understanding of the diffusion of cultural products through Twitter.

The aim of this paper is to develop a systemic risk model which, differently from existing ones, employs not only the information contained in financial market prices, but also big data coming from financial tweets. From a methodological viewpoint, we propose a new framework, based on categorical graphical models, that can estimate systemic risks with models based on two different sources: financial markets and financial tweets, and suggest a way to combine them, using a Bayesian approach. From an applied viewpoint, we present the first systemic risk model based on big data, and show that such a model can shed further light on the interrelationships between financial institutions. This can help predicting the level of returns of a bank, conditionally on the others, for example when a shock occurs in another bank.

This is addressed through semantic mapping of process. We note how this is complementary to the primacy of output results or products. We use goal-oriented discourse as a case study. We draw benefit from how social and political theorist, Jürgen Habermas, uses what was termed 'communicative action'. An orientation in Habermas's work, that we use, is analysis of communication or discourse. For this, we take Twitter social media. In our case study, we map the discourse semantically, using the correspondence analysis platform for such latent semantic analysis. This permits qualitative and quantitative analytics. Our case study is a set of eight carefully planned Twitter campaigns relating to environmental issues. The aim of these campaigns was to increase environmental awareness and behaviour. Each campaign was launched by an initiating tweet. Using the data gathered in these Twitter campaigns, we sought to map them, and hence to track the flow of the Twitter discourse. This mapping was achieved through semantic embedding. The semantic distance between an initiating act and the aggregate semantic outcome is used as a measure of process effectiveness.

This classification is often based on a bag-of-words approach that counts the frequencies of sentiment terms from a predefined vocabulary, ignoring the contexts for these words. We test an aspect-based network analysis model that computes sentiment about an entity from the shortest paths between the sentiment words and the target word across a corpus. Two ground-truth datasets in which human annotators judged whether tweets were positive or negative enabled testing the internal and external validity of the automated network-based method, evaluating the extent to which this approach's scoring corresponds to the annotations. We found that tweets annotated as negative had an automated negativity score that was nearly twice as strong than positivity, while positively annotated tweets were six times stronger in positivity than negativity. To assess the predictive validity of the approach, we analyzed sentiment associated with coronavirus coverage in television news from January 1 to March 25, 2020. Support was found for the four hypotheses tested, demonstrating the utility of the approach. H1: broadcast news expresses less sentiment about coronavirus, panic, and social distancing than non-broadcast news outlets. H2: there is a negative bias in the news across channels. H3: sentiment increases are associated with an increased volume of news stories. H4: sentiment is associated with uncertainty in news coverage of coronavirus over time. We also found that as the type of channel moved from broadcast network news to 24-h business, general, and foreign news sentiment increased for coronavirus, panic, and social distancing.

Today, the digital environment seems to be an adequate space for this exploration and the emergence of the Web 2.0 offers common people the possibility of expressing and sharing their opinions on a daily basis. Due to the ubiquity of technology, Internet and social media in people's lives, socialization and its expressiveness have changed. If this is the case, the means to measure the perceptions, opinions and judgements of citizens should also change. The immense quantity of data available to be analysed today poses a challenge for the traditional scientific model. In this sense, it could be necessary for social research to move towards the analysis of the web and consider the potential predictive capacity of digital demoscopy. A new field of study has opened, with interest in exploring the predictive capacity of social media in electoral contexts. As a research group comprised by linguists, communication experts and engineers we explored the predictive potential of social media in three national elections that took place in Chile during 2017. Our objective was to explore a methodological design that allows predicting the result of political elections through the use of inductive algorithms and the automatic processing of messages with political opinion in social media. Through computational intelligence, we were able to follow, collect and analyse millions of tweets, and to improve our forecast each time. Our learning based on empirical research was fundamental to improve our procedures and to refine our variables and, thus, improve our prediction.

The analysis shows that online networking yields a storage mechanism through which any individual contribution-e.g. a blog post, a comment, or a photo-is stored within a particular network and ready for virtual access by each member who connects to the network. When someone provides feedback, for example by commenting on a note, or by replying to a message, the interaction is finalized. These interactions are asynchronous, i.e. they allow individuals to relate in different moments, whenever they have time to. When the social environment is poor of participation opportunities and/or the pressure on time increases (for example due to the need to increase the working time), the stock of information and ties stored in the Internet can help individuals to defend their sociability.

The main purpose of this article is to show the relationship between citizen journalism and mainstream journalism in covering Syrian news, and how peace journalism represents in both. A questionnaire designed to analyze the content of five Syrian events on Aljazeera news channel. The five Syrian events are Al-Bayda and Baniyas, the siege of Bab Amr, al Qusair and Khalidiya in Homs, Yarmouk camp, chemical on Al Gota. Result shows that Aljazeera uses a significant number of footages and contents which came from Syrian citizen journalists; it is presented as 46.3 %. Due to shared political agendas between Aljazeera and citizen journalists, Aljazeera depends on their footages more than their own reporters while they are covering Syrian news. Majority of footages reflect Syrian opposition and the killing of Syrians which resulted from Al-Assad Regime. We suggest that news content published by citizen journalists on their blogs and YouTube should be analyzed for other studies.

By applying this approach to examine citizen participation on social media, this study introduces an empirical strategy for collecting data on social media tools used by governments and identifies patterns of citizens' e-participation and relationships between citizens, governments, and various organizations involved in policymaking processes through social media. The results based on the 311 service platforms of New York City and San Francisco suggest that the webometric approach can not only extract government agencies' communication behaviors toward others on social media but also capture the overall network structure, the pattern of interactions between participants, and network properties of participants.

Although online harassment, or cyber aggression, has begun to receive attention, little research systematically explores the common themes found in hostile messages. In this project, we focused on online harassment directed towards women of color. We applied social network methodology and text clustering (topic analysis) to messages posted on the social media platform Twitter. We examined the occurrence of aggressive, harmful Twitter messages directed towards two groups-Hispanic/Latinx women and Black women. Next, we uncovered common themes that emerged within the communications. Messages towards both groups of women contained themes of racial stereotypes. In tweets that targeted Black women, one emergent theme concerned charges of promiscuity, where messages included slurs that accused Black women of being overly sexual. In messages containing Latinx slurs, on the other hand, xenophobia was one recurring topic, with common terms related to menial labor and political comments invoking the need to ""build a wall."" Both groups of women also were subjected to feminine, attractiveness insults. Findings suggest that these negative communications are not idiosyncratic in nature, but instead routinely reinforce traditional, negative, race and gender stereotypes. As a result, these hostile messages contribute to the maintenance of race and gender inequality.",Social media; Gender; GENDER; Networks; Race; NETWORKS; Cyberbullying; AGGRESSION; ANTI-IMMIGRANT; INTERSECTIONALITY; Online harassment; POPULATIONS; VICTIMIZATION,WOS,16,,,,,,,

Talkback radio has been traditionally perceived as a participatory form of media, albeit limited by various gatekeeping and rules of access. However, the nature of talkback with its traditional reliance on voice and performance is changing as programmes are increasingly offering audience members the opportunity to contribute to programmes via e-mail, Short Messaging Service (SMS) and, more recently, websites and social media. This article contributes to an under-explored area of talkback radio studies by examining audience 'participation' in talkback programmes via SMS and e-mail. It draws data from focus groups with audiences of twelve Australian commercial and non-commercial talkback radio programmes to discover why some study participants use SMS and e-mail and why some do not contribute via these technologies. The article also examines, in what circumstances and for what purposes these talkback radio listeners use these technologies. Inductive coding was used to analyse the data through the computer program NVivo. We conclude that while study participants strongly associated talkback with phone calls, e-mail and SMS are largely accepted as regular methods of contributing to and communicating with talkback radio programmes. There is much more work to be undertaken on the topic of non-verbal contributions to talkback radio, particularly with the increasing use of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which this article has not explored.

Since social media platforms seem to provide an increasingly relevant space for generational stereotyping that highlights conflict between younger and older generations, investigating ageism towards older people expressed on social media during the pandemic is deemed particularly important. This article explores ageing discourses circulated within the Italian Twittersphere during the first peak of the Covid-19 emergency. It draws on a dataset of 7M+ Covid-related tweets collected in the first phase of the health crises. Through quanti-qualitative analysis, it explores Twitter content related to Covid-19 and older people: 110,316 tweets detected taking advantage of a set of ad hoc keywords (e.g., anzian*, vecch*). Drawing on our findings, we show that explicit stereotypical opinions are quite residual, and we put forth and discuss the concept of platformised ageing discourse to explain how social media platforms' structure and functioning affect ageing-related cultural production.

The latter deems the Internet as a fragmented and individualized space, which, by definition, destroys any possibility of collective deliberation and discussion.

Through a quantitative-qualitative analysis, grounded on the digital methods paradigms and based on a dataset of 181085 tweets collected during the Primarie of Centro Sinistra 2012, we would like to show how Twitter can be conceived of as a civic device that permits a specific political discourse and new forms of political association to be materialized - both entities that would remain unseen otherwise.

In the first one rejection was predominant over acceptance and neutrality. Rejection was smaller in the second one, showing how fluctuant these expressions are depending the media context. In both cases rejection toward migrants was significantly bigger than over refugees, as it had already been observed in international contexts. This work also created a training corpus about immigrant rejection, valid for future studies, and observed the negative aspects most frequently associated to rejection of immigrants, as well as the relationship existing between this and the fact of tweets being information or opinion.

One recent form of media is TikTok, an app that hit the United States in 2016 before catapulting to popularity in 2018. This article is a conversation between TikTok creator/social worker eli hess and social work professor/TikTok creator Shanna Kattari about the ways that TikTok has been/can be used for educational purposes. We address using TikTok both to teach students in formal social work programs and to engage the masses around topics related to social justice. We reflect on this method of social justice education and pose questions about this approach. Topics of discussion include personal impact of using TikTok, professional/personal challenges, and ways that TikTok content can be used in social work education and practice.

Today's ever-changing socio-political and environmental landscape requires social workers to look beyond internal divisions and focus on the central values that drive the profession. With an increasingly diverse population and more complex problems including globalization, the redistribution of political power, increased privatization of services, and increased exposure to the influence of social media, social work is more relevant than ever. We suggest social workers bridge the divide in practice and education by embracing technology through #MacroSW chats on Twitter and by refraining from thinking of micro and macro practice as polarized constructs, while remaining true to the profession's foundational roots of social justice, knowledge, and ethics.

Thus, students' perceptions of teacher credibility are affected by what instructors post on their social media profiles. The participants in the study were 166 students from the Faculty of Education Sciences at the University of Seville, carried out using a quasiexperimental methodology for which three Twitter profiles for a university professor were created with professional, social and mixed content. For the analysis of the results, normality and homoscedasticity tests were carried out on the sample to decide which statistical tests to use. The most salient results indicated that students perceived the professional profile as more competent, more caring, and more trustworthy, followed by the mixed profile and, lastly, by the social profile. Positive correlations were also found between students who perceived the university professor as reflected in the professional profile as credible in their academic motivation. The findings and their practical implications for instructors are discussed in terms of how they can incorporate Twitter into their teaching, considering the needs of their students to enhance their learning.

Initial work by Lovejoy and Saxton suggests NGOs use digital platforms such as Twitter to engage their constituencies through information dissemination, community building, and mobilization to action. Here, we explore the applicability of Lovejoy and Saxton’s communicative functions framework to resistance movement behavior by exploring two examples of digital engagement in political conflict. Through content analysis of tweets using hashtag indicators #BDS and #ICC4Israel collected during the spring of 2015, we affirm Lovejoy and Saxton’s findings that information dissemination is the most prevalent communication function for grassroots and institutionally grounded movements. Further, we find that informational tweets in our sample often provide information about grievances, and therefore propose an expansion of the framework to accommodate tweets that may be more common in resistance movements than in NGO communication. In addition to general findings about the communicative functions framework, the content analysis yielded several findings specific to the resistance movements studied. Notably, we find that #BDS and #ICC4Israel tweets are overwhelmingly nonviolent, and that sentiment is generally favorable across both hashtags, with the exception of tweets focusing on academic boycott, which were more ambiguous.

Recently, this trend has manifested through several high-profile incidents of foreign firms censoring controversial content outside of China in order to retain access to the Chinese consumer market. This article argues that China is uniquely situated to leverage this type of market power due to its enormous, growing consumer base and authoritarian structure. This form of 'exporting' censorship can occur in three ways: content bans, position reversal, and self-censorship. Outward-facing firms, especially in the entertainment industry, are particularly vulnerable to this type of pressure as their employees, including actors, athletes, and celebrity CEOs, may have an independent following and audience for their personal views. By analyzing the controversy between China and the National Basketball Association over a single tweet in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, this article demonstrates the conditions under which censorship efforts may be outsourced to private, foreign actors in jurisdictions outside of China.

This study looks at the Twitter messages of the candidates for the Presidency of Mexico in the 2018 elections and reviews their contents, the reactions they produced, and whether they were interpreted positively or negatively. The hypothesis, which our research sustains, is that, although social networks can be considered to foster relations between the political class and citizens, Twitter functions as an instrument for unilateral information and only reaffirms recurrent interactions in the political culture without fostering citizen participation. In addition, the use of computational tools, particularly sentiment analysis, is proposed as a methodological tool to obtain and analyse information related to political activity.",NEWS; SOCIAL MEDIA; Elections; ONLINE; ELECTION; Sentiment Analysis; CANDIDATES USE; Election Campaigns; POLITICAL-PARTICIPATION; Public Perception; TWITTER USE,WOS,3,,,,,,,
