Hammon's hiring provided an impetus to examine how Twitter opened avenues for discussions around gender in sport culture to generate and permeate. Using Radian6 social media extraction software a sample of 1,434 tweets were obtained. A thematic analysis was conducted and revealed three themes: (a) opening the space for conversation; (b) offering evidence of sport cultural change; and (c) expressing resistance to sport cultural change. The results suggest that Twitter functions as a space where aspects of sport culture are disseminated and contested in ways that transcend traditional media's treatment of these topics. As people share content that is personally meaningful and relevant and participate in shared conversations about sport cultural issues, it invites them to engage in active citizenry through joining in these discussions.",SOCIAL MEDIA; BASKETBALL; BODY; FACEBOOK; HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY; MEN; OPPORTUNITIES; PROTESTS; WOMEN,WOS,55,,,,,,,

Content analysis confirmed that cultural backlash exists in sport and provided insight into manifestations of backlash. Comments exhibiting backlash varied by subject (i.e., what or who is being discussed in the tweet) and attitude (i.e., positive approval for fighting and negative attitude toward change), with many defending hockey masculinity.

This article uses Twitter, the most popular social media website, as its focus. Recently, the social media site has been prominently associated with social movements in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria. Rather than rush to breathlessly describe its novel role in shaping contemporary social movements, this article takes a step back and considers Twitter in historical and broad sociological terms. This article is not intended to provide empirical evidence or a fully formed theoretical understanding of Twitter, but rather to provide a selected literature review and a set of directions for sociologists. The article makes connections specifically to Erving Goffman's interactionist work, not only to make the claim that some existing sociological theory can be used to think critically about Twitter, but also to provide some initial thoughts on how such theoretical innovations can be developed.",Twitter; social media; IDENTITY; COMMUNICATION; computer-mediated technology; Goffman; self-production,WOS,496,,,,,,,

Usually centred on 'newsworthy' events and collective 'flows' of emotion, this work is often computationally driven. This article presents an interaction-led analysis of small data from Twitter to illustrate how this kind of intensive focus can 'thicken' claims about emotions, and particularly empathy. Drawing on Goffman's work on ritual, we introduce and then apply the idea of 'empathy rituals' to exchanges about emotional distress on Twitter, a platform primarily researched using big data approaches. While the potential of Goffman's work has been explored in some depth in relation to digital performances, its emotional dimension has been less fully examined. Through a focus on Twitter conversations, we show how reading small data can inform computational social science claims about emotions and add to sociological understanding of emotion in (digital) publics.",ONLINE; Twitter; Emotions; rituals; Goffman,WOS,45,,,,,,,

By cross-referencing survey data with longitudinal Twitter data and in-depth interviews, we investigate the relationship between biographical availability, relational and organisational ties, and social and personal costs to persistent activism online and on location. Contrary to expectations, we find no clear-cut relationship between those factors and sustained commitment to participation in the occupation. We show that persistent activist communication did not feed into enduring organisational structures despite the continuous online activity observed during and beyond the peak of the Gezi occupation.

I argue that the relational emphasis of field theory, modified by the concept of media meta-capital, can be a fruitful way of examining the social context in which representations of Muslims are produced. This advances scholarship that relies too heavily on content analysis to support judgements about news representations of Muslims. I use examples from original fieldwork in Glasgow to discuss the capital, autonomy and heteronomy of Muslim sources who are 'authorised knowers' and 'new entrants' in their source communities. These various positions are evident in their relative success in managing journalist-source relations, which encompass 'legacy' media platforms and emerging communication tools such as Twitter.

Social media and new computational methods provide a solution. Our study clusters cities using sociality as a metric. We collected three months of social media data to investigate variation in the temporal structure of sociability across American cities. We find that cities cluster into three distinct types ('Coastal', 'Transitional' and 'Heartland') and that geographic proximity together with race, education and language associate with this clustering. Specifically, we found that clusters of Blacker cities tend to tweet more per capita, but also that more highly educated cities tend to tweet less per capita. These findings provide evidence that social media may be facilitating new opportunities to empower traditionally marginalized urban groups, a conclusion relevant to #BlackLivesMatter, the George Floyd protests and other social movements.",social media; network analysis; SOCIOLOGY; INNOVATION; city dynamics; daily life; temporality; urban studies; CITY; GROWTH; PLACES; SEGREGATION,WOS,0,,,,,,,

Institutionalist theories of social control suggest that such interventions can be efficacious if they are perceived as legitimate, whereas theories of psychological reactance suggest that users may instead ratchet up aggressive behavior in response to the sanctioning authority. In a sample of 3.6 million tweets spanning one month before and one month after Twitter’s policy change, the authors find evidence of a modest positive shift in the average sentiment of tweets with slurs targeting women and/or African Americans. The authors further illustrate this trend by tracking the network spread of specific tweets and individual users. Retweeted messages are more negative than those not forwarded. These patterns suggest that organizational “anti-abuse” policies can play a role in stemming hateful speech on social media without inflaming further abuse.",,SAGE,5,,,,,,,

In this article, we evaluate potential gender biases of commercial image recognition platforms using photographs of U.S. members of Congress and a large number of Twitter images posted by these politicians. Our crowdsourced validation shows that commercial image recognition systems can produce labels that are correct and biased at the same time as they selectively report a subset of many possible true labels. We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men. We discuss how encoded biases such as these affect the visibility of women, reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, and limit the validity of the insights that can be gathered from such data.",,SAGE,0,,,,,,,

The authors begin to address this gap through an analysis of 245,020 tweets collected before and after Twitter suspended eight accounts calling for state audits of the 2020 presidential election results. In this analysis of message amplifiers, or accounts receiving 200 or more retweets, and message drivers, or top-ranked accounts, no evidence is found that the Twitter ban improved the ideas or the quality of information shared about the election, nor did it dramatically change who posted about the audit.

Then, the author examines whether Twitter sentiment represents the gender attitudes of diverse populations by predicting the effect of Twitter sentiment on individuals’ gender attitudes across race, gender, and education level. The results indicate that Twitter sentiment toward feminism is highly correlated with gender attitudes, suggesting that Twitter is a useful measure of public opinion about gender.

In conducting an analysis of 240 tweets, memes, and political cartoons from the 2016 U.S. presidential election targeting the two frontrunners, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we see how popular political humor often reaffirmed heteronormative assumptions of gender, sexuality, and race and equated scripts of hegemonic masculinity with presidential ability.

The results indicate that female House members’ underrepresentation in the media mirrors their underrepresentation in public office.

Specifically, this paper observes the political mediascape post-GE14 via a database from Malaysia's 'Twitter-verse' and a collective of civil society groups (e.g., Projek Dialog, Warga Dunia, Borneo Komrad) in order to substantiate the idea of a 'digital rhizomorph'. The digital rhizomorph is defined in this study as a body of contemporary youth politics that are more experimental and collaborative than hierarchical in character. The digital rhizomorph offers a more nuanced understanding of the original concept of the 'rhizome', often reflecting and morphing based on several key factors identified in the fieldwork.

The research methodology incorporates the technology acceptance paradigm and a model of technology adoption and usage. The survey was developed, checked for accuracy, and released to the public.

These results have real-world and theoretical ramifications for policymakers and entrepreneurial education, such as using widely used yet cutting-edge communication and Internet tools to inspire young people to start their own businesses. In this analysis, we test the hypothesis that there is a connection between the time spent on social networking sites (SNS) and measures of confidence in, and desire for, starting one's own business. Over two hundred and fifty female students from Private Universities in Bangladesh participated in online questionnaires and correlation tests. More time spent on social networking sites is correlated with more serious business thinking and behavior. Students of all sexes and all ages use Facebook, but younger students and women in particular associate the platform with entrepreneurial aspirations and attitudes more strongly than their male counterparts. There is a greater understanding of the relationship between social media presence and entrepreneurship factors because to this research. The researchers sorted the interviewees' responses into four groups based on their findings: how often they used SNS, how much they felt supported by SNS, how secure they felt in their entrepreneurial conduct, and how ambitious they wanted to be as business owners' Important motifs were also determined for each class. Institutions of higher learning may and should use social media to promote and educate aspiring business owners.

Participants were invited to follow one of the Twitter accounts of nine candidates from the main political parties during the 2019 European Parliament electoral campaign in Spain. Experiment compliance among participants was confirmed using web-tracking data (passive metre). The results show that exposure to candidates' Twitter accounts by self-selection does not increase affective polarisation. Although high levels of polarisation might contribute to building echo chambers, the polarising content contained in the partisan Twitter accounts has no effect on increasing affective polarisation, even among those who strongly identify with such parties. This finding confirms the so-called limited media effect hypothesis for social media.

Wael Ghonim, a prominent activist in the revolution, proclaimed, ""If you want to free a society, just give them Internet access."" The virtual-physical hybrid protest is becoming the new paradigm in political discourse and action around the world. But can Internet access equal political access, and if so, what role is left for physical public space? This paper will examine the requirements democracy places on the public sphere, and explore the capacities of virtual and physical space with respect to these requirements. Nancy Fraser's theories of the public demonstrate that political discourse has different spatial needs depending on the stage of development. Subaltern-counterpublics need low access and visibility for withdrawal and regroupment, but high access and visibility to successfully disseminate their message. Protests in Cairo, Egypt and Seattle, Washington have shown that the speed and horizontal structure of virtual public space fills the needs of the first stage effectively. However, when political discourse moves into wider arenas, virtual space is not enough. The symbolism, imagery, and phenomenological experience of physical space play a more important role in effecting awareness and change. Despite the power of social media, effective political action must still go out into the square.

This study found that sports organizations used multiple Twitter communication tools such as hyperlinks, hashtags, public messages, and retweets, among which hashtags were most frequently utilized. There was a significant association between relationship dimensions and sports organizations' use of communication tools. Furthermore, their use of specific communication tools of Twitter (i.e. public messages and retweets) influenced public engagement. The theoretical and practical implications of this study were also discussed.
