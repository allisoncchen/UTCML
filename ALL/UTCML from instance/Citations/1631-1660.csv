This study had a 2 (sender: celebrity vs. noncelebrity) × 2 (communication type: poster advertisement vs. Twitter word-of-mouth [WOM]) × 2 (recipient involvement: high vs. low) design. Data were collected from 259 Korean university students. Results showed that a celebrity poster advertisement had a more positive effect on consumer attitude than did a noncelebrity poster advertisement. In contrast, with Twitter WOM, the noncelebrity message sender was more effective in eliciting a positive response from consumers. The interaction of sender, communication type, and recipient involvement for musical ticket purchase intention was significant. Our findings will help marketers strategically allocate resources, as the effect of celebrity endorsement differed according to communication type and recipient characteristics. Specifically, in the social networking site promotion condition, the similarity or social connection between the message sender and recipient was more influential than was the power of a celebrity to attract consumers.

Results showed that self-disclosure and need for affiliation had a significantly positive impact on both brand attitude and purchase intention. In addition, social identity had a significantly positive impact on consumers' electronic word-of-mouth intention. Overall, my results indicate that, as one component of an advertising strategy, celebrity endorsement in social media contexts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) is effective.

Prior research demonstrates that violent repression can either decrease protest participation through raising the costs of participation, or can generate outrage, resulting in ""backfire"" and an increase in mobilization. Many recent mass mobilizations have garnered attention from scholars and journalists alike due to the instances of repression backfiring as well as the widespread use of social media in these protest movements. We examine why these two trends may be related using logistic regression analysis on data on participants in the Gezi Park Protests in summer 2013. Controlling for confounding factors, we find a statistically significant relationship between being recruited to participate in the protests through social media and joining the mass mobilization as a reaction to police repression. We argue that in the case of Gezi Park, communication through social media was a key factor in facilitating social movement mobilization in response to repression.",social media; mobilization; repression; backfire; collective behavior and social movements,WOS,25,,,,,,,

Protestors are able to coalesce around particular keywords such as found in the use of 'hashtags' on the SNS Twitter, while sympathetic audiences across the globe are able to follow events in real time. While the role of Twitter use in protests has been celebrated as a means of reducing the information asymmetry between protestors and police, this article problematises this view by exploring the ways in which social media data are beneficial to law enforcement agencies and the state. The article examines the extent to which intelligence agencies are able to monitor activists, drawing on the Edward Snowden revelations of widespread SNS surveillance, and the ways in which internet users are altering their online activities as a result of the revelations. Far from challenging the state, social media use and the data it provides offer the state a multitude of resources to extend its reach and to ensure political order.

In our paper, we focus on what businesses communicate about CSR through social media and how this relates to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We identified the topics discussed on Twitter, their evolution over time, and the differences across sectors. We applied the structural topic model (STM) algorithm, which allowed us to estimate the model, including document-level metadata (time and sector). This model proved to be a powerful tool for topic detection and the estimation of the effects of time and sector on the discussion proportion of the topics. Indeed, we found that the topics were well identified overall, and the model allowed catching signals from the data. We derived CSR communication indexes directly from the topic model (TM) results and propose the use of dissimilarity and homogeneity indexes to describe the communication mix and highlight differences and identify clusters.

We then explore the determinants of happiness in our sample. Static variables such as the overall quality of institutions seem to matter only marginally in affecting the average level of happiness of the Italian provinces.

Dynamic and multi-dimensional characteristics of QoL ask for new data sources to update the relevant indicators and novel methods for QoL assessment. This research presents a comprehensive framework for assessing QoL in intra-national level. To address current challenges, the focus has been on integrating subjective and objective criteria, using the geotagged Tweets as user-generated geo-contents (UGGCs) to extract some subjective criteria, and utilizing a multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the cumulative belief degree (CBD) method to integrate and provide the final output. The proposed framework is implemented to assess the QoL in the provinces of Iran as the case study. Based on the obtained results, Tehran has a better QoL status, while Sistan-and-Balouchestan and Kermanshah have rather unsuitable conditions compared to other provinces. Results show the potential of the UGGCs to cover the dynamic characteristics of QoL and to complement the official data. Also, the functional capabilities of the CBD method in integrating heterogeneous criteria, handling uncertainty, and suitably providing the final results of QoL assessment in different scenarios allow authorities to get a more comprehensive, realistic view on QoL issues. The proposed method of this research is a step toward an integrated assessment of QoL using the data shared by people in the location-based social networks which could be regarded as a novel and useful tool for administrators in the field of QoL.

This paper aims to analyse the relationship between city residents' well-being and three established indicators: economic growth (as measured by GDP per capita), population size, and green space. A Big Data approach based on the lexica used on social media was proposed to develop well-being indicators. Using the 2016 data of Weibo (i.e. the Chinese version of Twitter), this study finds that the relationship between residents' well-being and GDP per capita and the relationship between residents' well-being and population size both form inverted U-shaped curves. Specifically, for poor cities, levels of well-being increase as GDP per capita increases. But after peaking at around the median GDP per capita point, levels of well-being drop as the city's economy continues to increase. Similarly, levels of well-being increase with population size for small cities, but decrease for those cities whose population sizes rank in the top quarter. In contrast, there is a positive relationship between well-being and the percentage of green space for all cities. Implications and future directions are discussed.

Thus, the purpose of the work is to understand United Nations World Environment Day (WED) programs impact on the digital public debate using Twitter data mining. For that, an ad hoc methodology is designed to provide it to authorities and organizations that wish to analyze the impact of different initiatives or programs on society. All in all, the research carried out analyzes more than 400,000 tweets sent during the 2021 edition of the WED. The tweets have been processed using Big Data techniques and Social Network Analysis. The research reveals that the WED was a trending topic initiative that was discussed in positive terms, where collective sentiment was shown. The topics covered dealt with the event day and the different initiatives related to restoration of ecosystems. However, it is noted that: there is no coordinated action by the institutions, groups or individuals involved in the conversation and the initiative tends towards homophily; digital mobilization is mostly centered in the host country (Pakistan) and, above all, in the neighboring country (India) and, the conspicuous absence of the business sphere in the discussion.",Twitter; Environmental programs; FRAMEWORK; POLITICS; SNA metrics; Social network analysis; SPAIN; World Environment Day,WOS,2,,,,,,,

Contrary to questionnaires, analyzing social media allows to nowcast happiness in real-time, including mapping its fluctuation due to the occurrence of extemporaneous facts. Our data set comprises over 43 millions of tweets posted on a daily basis in all the 110 Italian provinces and collected during 2012. In measuring happiness, we construct an original index using innovative statistical techniques to quantify the level of happiness at the provincial level related to a specific amount of tweets. We then explore the determinants of happiness in our sample. Static variables such as the overall quality of institutions seem to matter only marginally in affecting the average level of happiness of the Italian provinces. On the contrary, meteorological variables and events related to specific days, such as the variability of the spread between German and Italian Bonds or the payday, have the largest impact.",Social media; MEDIA; KNOWLEDGE; Happiness; INCOME; LIFE; PREFERENCES; Textual analysis,WOS,74,,,,,,,

Despite its importance, this is still a relatively underexamined and emerging topic. In our paper, we focus on what businesses communicate about CSR through social media and how this relates to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We identified the topics discussed on Twitter, their evolution over time, and the differences across sectors. We applied the structural topic model (STM) algorithm, which allowed us to estimate the model, including document-level metadata (time and sector). This model proved to be a powerful tool for topic detection and the estimation of the effects of time and sector on the discussion proportion of the topics. Indeed, we found that the topics were well identified overall, and the model allowed catching signals from the data. We derived CSR communication indexes directly from the topic model (TM) results and propose the use of dissimilarity and homogeneity indexes to describe the communication mix and highlight differences and identify clusters.",Social media; MEDIA; STRATEGIES; Corporate sustainability; CSR; Indicators; Structural topic model; SUSTAINABILITY; Sustainable development; TEXT; Text mining,WOS,4,,,,,,,

We account for measures of trust in strangers (often referred to as social trust), trust in neighbours (particularized trust) and trust in the police (institutional trust). We address endogeneity in the use of SNS by exploiting the variation in the availability of broadband for high-speed Internet, which relates to technological characteristics of the pre-existing voice telecommunication infrastructures. We find that all the forms of trust significantly decrease with participation in online networks. We discuss several interpretations of the results in light of the specific features of Internet-mediated social interaction.",IMPACT; Trust; INTERNET; PARTICIPATION; Social networking sites; Hate speech; Facebook; Internet; Social capital; TRENDS; UNITED-STATES; Broadband; Online networks; DECLINE; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR,WOS,0,,,,,,,

The aim of this work is to obtain a classification of each tweet in the corpus according to the ""Information""-""Action"" categories, in order to detect whether a tweet refers to an event or it has only an informative-disclosure purpose. It seems particularly interesting to understand how and to what extent people and organizations are playing a more active role in shaping the process of responding locally and internationally to climate change. Explicit intention to act or inform had been captured by hand coding of a randomly selected sample of tweets and then the classification had been extended to the whole corpus through a supervised machine learning method.

The methodology is applied to different corpora obtained by collecting Twitter messages about three topics of the agenda setting related to security. It operates in two steps, in the first one, ETM is performed in order to identify topic representation and sentiment. In the second step, this information is transformed in a stream of numerical data and a composite index aggregates the information on the sentiment related to the three topics. The composite index embeds a penalty function, which reduces the weight of the sequences, which show the greatest volatility over time. Results show that this procedure allows for real-time measurement of the perception of security, which is mostly negative. It is net of the effect of communication hype, and it enables to quantify reliably any potential change in the public perception.",SOCIAL MEDIA; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; Security; ISSUE; Composite index; Emotional text mining; Public perception; Wellbeing; CRIME; FEAR; SAFETY,WOS,30,,,,,,,

This paper aims to analyse the relationship between city residents' well-being and three established indicators: economic growth (as measured by GDP per capita), population size, and green space. A Big Data approach based on the lexica used on social media was proposed to develop well-being indicators. Using the 2016 data of Weibo (i.e. the Chinese version of Twitter), this study finds that the relationship between residents' well-being and GDP per capita and the relationship between residents' well-being and population size both form inverted U-shaped curves. Specifically, for poor cities, levels of well-being increase as GDP per capita increases. But after peaking at around the median GDP per capita point, levels of well-being drop as the city's economy continues to increase. Similarly, levels of well-being increase with population size for small cities, but decrease for those cities whose population sizes rank in the top quarter. In contrast, there is a positive relationship between well-being and the percentage of green space for all cities. Implications and future directions are discussed.",Well-being; Big Data; HEALTH; INCOME; Chinese social media; City level; Economic growth; Green space; Population size; LANGUAGE; HAPPINESS; GREEN SPACE; LIFE SATISFACTION,WOS,0,,,,,,,

Dynamic and multi-dimensional characteristics of QoL ask for new data sources to update the relevant indicators and novel methods for QoL assessment. This research presents a comprehensive framework for assessing QoL in intra-national level. To address current challenges, the focus has been on integrating subjective and objective criteria, using the geotagged Tweets as user-generated geo-contents (UGGCs) to extract some subjective criteria, and utilizing a multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the cumulative belief degree (CBD) method to integrate and provide the final output. The proposed framework is implemented to assess the QoL in the provinces of Iran as the case study. Based on the obtained results, Tehran has a better QoL status, while Sistan-and-Balouchestan and Kermanshah have rather unsuitable conditions compared to other provinces. Results show the potential of the UGGCs to cover the dynamic characteristics of QoL and to complement the official data. Also, the functional capabilities of the CBD method in integrating heterogeneous criteria, handling uncertainty, and suitably providing the final results of QoL assessment in different scenarios allow authorities to get a more comprehensive, realistic view on QoL issues. The proposed method of this research is a step toward an integrated assessment of QoL using the data shared by people in the location-based social networks which could be regarded as a novel and useful tool for administrators in the field of QoL.",Quality of life; SOCIAL MEDIA; Well-being; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; Geoinformatics; Geospatial analysis; Location-based social networks; Multi-criteria decision analysis; TWITTER; HAPPINESS; ENVIRONMENT; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; URBAN LIFE,WOS,0,,,,,,,
