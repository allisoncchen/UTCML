Investigating Nike's Corporate Responsibility Initiatives in Sport for Development and Peace,JOURNAL OF SPORT & SOCIAL ISSUES,10.1177/0193723516655579,,"Inspired by assertions of creeping commercialization in issues of social justice, this article seeks to address the entanglement of privatization with sport for development and peace initiatives. We look specifically at Nike's history of social responsibility to situate the N7 initiative, for Indigenous health, within a larger landscape of privatized social justice. Critical discourse analysis was used to unpack Nike's annual corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. In addition, a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the #DeChief movement, which lobbies against the use of Native mascotry, was conducted via the social media platform, Twitter. The authors observed public criticism against Nike's incongruous business practices in supporting Indigenous health on one hand, and financially benefitting from the sale of harmful Indigenous caricatures on the other.","GIRLS; POWER; corporate social responsibility; CSR; activism; corporatization; sport for development and peace; GOVERNANCE; CULTURAL CITIZENSHIP; ""Native"" mascotry; CANADA; INDIANS; PLAY; PRIVATE; RED",WOS,46,,,,,,,

In recent years, he has used it to quietly support the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2014, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by police on a Cleveland playground, just miles from where the Cavaliers play and just north of James's hometown of Akron. James declined to comment on the case, and a Twitter campaign#NoJusticeNoLeBronattempted to force his hand. This article examines the role of James as an athlete-activist, identifying four frames embedded in content around James and the Black Lives Matter movement: Brand LeBron; Established Voice, Higher Expectations; Attention, Not Aggression; and Community Versus Protest. We found James is cautious and deliberate in his activism, moderating a message of consideration rather than revolution, contextualized by his brand and ambitions.",MEDIA; RACE; Black Lives Matter; activism; LeBron James; athlete activism; PERCEPTIONS,WOS,131,,,,,,,

The feud originated in November 2017, when LaVar's son-University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) player LiAngelo Ball-was detained in Hangzhou, China, for shoplifting along with two of his UCLA teammates. After some tense moments, the three players were released and flown back to the United States. The U.S. President Donald Trump took credit, leading to a prolonged, prickly exchange with LaVar Ball. This article analyzes six major U.S. newspapers and six sports-specific outlets that covered the Trump-Ball feud. First, we identify the predominant frames that appeared in coverage. Second, we track whose views were included in the news and how sourcing inflected the appearance of particular frames. The incident highlights how racialized language-if coded and dog whistled-enters public discussion through the lens of sport. It also highlights the role of social media, especially Twitter, in influencing news production.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICS; GENDER; COVERAGE; RACE; framing analysis; coded language; dog whistle politics; sport news media; White racial frame; NORMS,WOS,3,,,,,,,

By conducting a comparative study of more than 40 different cases (covering topics such as elections, natural disasters, corporate crises, and televised events) we identify a number of distinct types of discussion that can be observed on Twitter. Drawing on a range of communicative metrics, we show that thematic and contextual factors influence the usage of different communicative tools available to Twitter users, such as original tweets, @replies, retweets, and URLs. Based on this first analysis of the overall metrics of Twitter discussions, we also demonstrate stable patterns in the use of Twitter in the context of major topics and events.

Using a sample of tweets with the #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft hashtags (n = 3,068), a Twitter conversation describing the reasons individuals left or stayed in abusive relationships, a traditional thematic analysis was used to qualitatively code the tweets. The same tweet sample was subject to a series of quantitative topic models. Results suggest topic modeling as a comparable approach to first-round qualitative analysis, with key differences: topic modeling and traditional thematic analysis are both inductive and phenomenon-oriented, but topic modeling results in a lexical semantic analysis, in contrast to the compositional semantic analysis offered by the qualitative approach. An evaluation of topics and codes using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software further supports these findings. We argue topic modeling is a useful method for the descriptive analysis of unstructured social media data sets, and is best used as part of a mixed-method strategy, with topic model results guiding deeper qualitative analysis. Implications for human service intervention development and evaluation are discussed.

Social scientists can hope to gain new insight into the previously hidden but digitally recorded aspects of our digital social lives. Beyond aggregate and individual-level studies of user behavior, the digital traces also enable scientific examination of the structure of social interaction through networks. At the same time, the large scale and networked nature of social media data pose a new set of challenges to be overcome through the development of sound methodologies. We take stock of current methodological promises and challenges in social media analysis. Community detection, a set of methods for the discovery of closely knit groups, is then presented as an intermediary step that enables application of existing traditional and network analytical approaches in a smaller setting more suited to social scientific questions. In closing, we argue that this network proximity-based clustering is often more useful for social media analysis than demographic grouping.

High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID‐19 have been observed among older adults and widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID‐19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN We obtained a representative sample of original tweets containing the keywords ""elderly,"" ""older,"" and/or ""boomer"" plus the hashtags ""#COVID19"" and/or ""#coronavirus."" SETTING Tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020. MEASUREMENTS We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as (1) informative, (2) personal accounts, (3) personal opinions, (4) advice seeking, (5) jokes, and (6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID‐19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS: A total of 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Overall, 72 tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone and 21.1% had content implying that the life of older adults was less valuable or downplayed the relevance of COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Most tweets related to COVID‐19 and older adults contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost one‐quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content toward older adults. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1661‐1665, 2020.

Although many of these organizations have cultivated an online presence, inquiry into the effectiveness of age advocacy work on social media remains an untapped area. Our foray into this topic explores how different tweet features predict the level of engagement of posts uploaded by age advocacy organizations on Twitter. Methods: Tweets (N = 403,426) were collected from 53 accounts and spanned 12 years from July 2009 to October 2021. After applying our exclusion criteria, 204,905 tweets were retained for analysis. We analyzed the tweet features (predictors) and engagement level (outcome variable) using a linear mixed‐effects model. Results: Tweets with higher engagement are those with a URL, with at least three hashtags, with visuals (GIF, photo, or video), which are quote tweets, and which are posted in the evening or at night Central Standard Time (CST), adjusting for account‐level variables (e.g., follower count). Conversely, tweets with more than one mention, which are replies and which are uploaded in the morning are associated with lower engagement. Conclusion: The rise of digital media means that advocates have the opportunity to communicate their messages to reach a critical mass. This is the first known study to offer an evidence‐informed playbook for age advocacy organizations to optimize outreach efforts by maximizing online engagement. These results represent a crucial step in ongoing efforts to tackle ageism, an issue that has long been under‐discussed.

Twitter-based journal clubs have demonstrated growth, sustainability, and worldwide communication, using a hashtag (#) to follow participation. This article describes the first year of #GeriMed JC, a monthly 1-hour live, 23-hour asynchronous Twitter-based complement to the traditional-format geriatric medicine journal club. The Twitter moderator tweets from the handle @GeriMed JC; encourages use of #GeriMed JC; and invites content experts, study authors, and followers to participate in critical appraisal of medical literature. Using the hashtag #GeriMed JC, tweets were categorized according to thematic content, relevance to the journal club, and authorship. Third-party analytical tools Symplur and Twitter Analytics were used for growth and effect metrics (number of followers, participants, tweets, retweets, replies, impressions). Qualitative analysis of follower and participant profiles was used to establish country of origin and occupation. A semistructured interview of postgraduate trainees was conducted to ascertain qualitative aspects of the experience. In the first year, @GeriMed JC has grown to 541 followers on six continents. Most followers were physicians (43%), two-thirds of which were geriatricians. Growth metrics increased over 12 months, with a mean of 121 tweets, 25 participants, and 105,831 impressions per journal club. Tweets were most often related to the article being appraised (87.5%) and ranged in thematic content from clinical practice (29%) to critical appraisal (24%) to medical education (20%). #GeriMed JC is a feasible example of using social media platforms such as Twitter to encourage international and interprofessional appraisal of medical literature.

This study provides a summary of key considerations and recommendations about using these platforms as research tools for dementia. DESIGN: Mixed methods. SETTING: Alzheimerʼs Societyʼs online Dementia Talking Point forum from inception to April 17, 2018, and Twitter in February and March 2018. PARTICIPANTS: All users of Dementia Talking Point who posted in subforums labeled ""I have dementia"" and ""I care for a person with dementia,"" and Twitter users whose posts contained the keywords ""dementia,"" ""Alzheimer,"" or ""Alzheimerʼs."" MEASUREMENTS: We quantified the average daily number of dementia‐related posts on each platform and number of words per post. Guided by a codebook, we conducted thematic content analysis of 5% of the 15,513 posts collected from Dementia Talking Point, and 10% of the 25,948 comprehensible posts from Twitter containing ""dementia,"" ""Alzheimer,"" or ""Alzheimerʼs."" We also summarized research‐relevant characteristics inherent to platforms and posts. RESULTS: On average, Dementia Talking Point provided less than two new daily dementia‐related posts with 213.5 to 241.5 words, compared with 7,883 new daily Twitter posts with 14.5 words. Persons with dementia (PWDs) commonly shared dementia‐related concerns (75.7%), experiences (68.6%), and requests for, as well as offers of, information and support (44.3% and 38.6%, respectively). Caregivers commonly shared caregiving experience (67.0%) and requests for information and support (52.5%). Most common dementia‐related Twitter posts were derogatory use of the term dementia (14.5%), advocacy, fundraising, and awareness (11.6%), and research dissemination (8.0%). Recommendations about these platformsʼ unique technical and ethical considerations are outlined. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the priorities of PWDs and their caregivers remains important to understand how clinicians can best support them. This study will help clinicians and researcher to better leverage online health forums and Twitter for such dementia‐related information.

Data were analyzed using a general linear model repeated‐measure design and Student t‐test. The primary outcome showed that Twitter Poll participants had more than twice the geriatrics knowledge (p =.002) than students who did not use Twitter Poll. Subset analysis showed different test performances according to sex (p =.03), training site (p =.002), and cohort (p =.003). This study is the first demonstration of Twitter Poll efficacy in medical education and raises questions about whether it could be even more effective if linked to spaced timing of didactic content or supported by annotated answers to geriatrics questions.

Social media channels, such as Twitter, provide a means of quickly reaching a wide array of users, globally. Besides standard tweets with links to research articles, visual abstracts are a means of delivering research results visually to end users succinctly. We compared the use of a standard tweet with a linked article with a tweet that held an added visual abstract, for a recent Journal of the American Geriatrics Society article. While the standard tweet received 24 984 impressions with 17 retweets and 36 likes over 8 days, the visual abstract inclusive tweet received 168 447 impressions with 81 retweets and 100 likes in 4 days. To assist researchers on future visual abstract development, we provide a framework and real‐world guide on translation of research abstracts into visual abstracts. We hope that by providing evidence and the means to create visual abstracts, researchers in geriatrics may be empowered to disseminate their research through this method and potentially advance the care of older adults worldwide.

I propose this move because social media platforms' mobilization of data – the extractions, ever‐shifting reaggregations, and micro‐targeting, on the one hand, and our engagements, re‐tweets, acts of sharing, and production of virality, on the other – has fuelled such anxious concern about the very things that animated much crowd theory in the first place. Key among these concerns are the force of emotional contagion and the threat of social dissolution; the composition of 'the social' by elements that well exceed the human; and pressing questions about the media through which energetic forces travel, often with lightning speed. What questions might be enabled by attending to the resonance between crowd theory's 'anti‐liberal' preoccupations and contemporary concerns over how social media platforms crowd us?

Access to social media allows individuals to shape event coverage beyond what is put forth by mainstream media through hashtag‐based communities. The death of Sahar Khodayari, or ""Blue Girl,"" an Iranian woman who committed suicide after being sentenced to prison for appearing in a sports stadium dressed as a man, is one such event that became a collective trauma. The current study sought to examine the collective trauma reaction among Farsi‐speaking Twitter users in response to Khodayari's death as represented in public tweets. The overall pool of data consisted of 8,653 tweets containing at least one of four hashtags (i.e., #BlueGirl, #Blue_Girl,, # #), posted September 9–24, 2019, as well as 603 tweets posted on the anniversary of the event 1 year later. Using thematic analysis, we identified three main themes within these public tweets representing different responses to Khodayari's death: social justice, awareness, and process. In undemocratic countries, like Iran, where there are limited free physical spaces for public gatherings, social media provides a platform for people to come together after tragic events to express emotions and discuss thoughts and actions. The present findings demonstrate that Twitter allowed Farsi‐speaking users to demand social justice, share awareness about #BlueGirl, and process their emotions and thoughts accordingly. Therefore, social media may provide a window into the collective trauma experience, and it may also serve as a new mode of studying trauma on new platforms.

We describe challenges and benefits of working with Twitter data and briefly review studies that used Twitter data to explore community responses to mass violence. We then demonstrate the use of Twitter data to examine community responses to a specific event: the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack, in which 14 people were killed and 22 were wounded. In a 6-week time frame around this attack, we evaluated the time course of community-level negative emotion. We downloaded 1.16 million tweets, representing 25,894 users from San Bernardino, CA, and a matched control community, Stockton, CA. All tweets were coded in R using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) negative emotion dictionary. A piecewise regression technique with a discontinuity analysis was used to evaluate pre- and postevent trajectories of negative emotion across the study window. Controlling for within-user variability, negative emotion increased by 6.2%, β = .182, SE = .014, p < .001, in San Bernardino on the day of the attack and remained elevated for 5 days; no elevation was observed in Stockton. We discuss how data-driven text analytic techniques are useful for exploring Twitter content generated after collective traumas and describe challenges and opportunities accompanying analyses of social media data to understand the impact of mass violence on affected populations.

We sought to evaluate the extent of this gap in knowledge. Methods: An online study using a standardized questionnaire was advertised through newsletters and websites of professional organizations. After a low response rate, the link to the survey was announced on Twitter and via personal email invitations. Differences between groups of respondents were evaluated with z-tests of proportion. Results: Out of 446 complete responses, there were 315 cardiologists and 112 obstetricians and gynecologists (OBGyns). There was an >90% awareness of association of adverse maternal outcomes with gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes with ASCVD, but only <60% awareness of association of adverse maternal outcomes with preterm birth. There were significant differences in ASCVD risk assessment and awareness of the association of APOs with adverse outcomes between cardiologists and OBGyns, and between female and male cardiologists. A greater proportion of female cardiologists thought that the guidelines recommended annual follow-up for high-risk women. Conversely, a greater proportion of male cardiologists were unsure of the frequency of follow-up of such women in the relevant guidelines. A higher proportion of U.K. respondents thought that women with high-risk pregnancies should never be screened for cardiovascular disease postpartum compared with U.S. respondents. Conclusions: In a self-selected group of health care professionals interested in women's cardiovascular health, there remains a large gap in knowledge and awareness of the association of APOs with ASCVD risk, in particular, a lack of awareness of the association of ASCVD risk with preterm delivery. Specific target groups for improving knowledge regarding these sex-specific risk enhancers include male cardiologists and health care professionals practicing in the United Kingdom.

This study aimed to quantify whether a social media strategy could: (1) amplify dissemination of gender equity-related articles and (2) collect proposed solutions to gender equity issues. Methods: In April 2018, eight published journal articles covering separate gender equity issues were presented in a 1-hour Twitter chat hosted by Physician's Weekly. Metrics data were collected before, during, and after the chat. During the chat, one question related to each article was tweeted at a time. Qualitative data were extracted from responses and evaluated for thematic content. Results: In the 16-hour period during and following the chat, we tallied 1500 tweets from 294 participants and 8.6 million impressions (potential views). The Altmetric Attention Score of each article increased (average, 126.5 points; range, 91–208 points). Within the respective journal, the Altmetric Rank of seven articles improved (range, 3 to ≥19), while the eighth maintained its #1 rank. The one article for which share and download data were available experienced a 729% increase in shares following prechat posts and another 113% bump after the chat, a 1667% increase overall (n = 45–795). Similarly, downloads, and presumably reads, increased 712% following prechat posts and another 47% bump after the chat, a 1093% increase overall (n = 394–4700). We tallied 181 potential solutions to the eight gender equity-related questions. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that social media can be used strategically to increase the dissemination of research articles and collect solution-focused feedback.

In May 2016, the Twitter hashtag #MaybeHeDoesntHitYou generated a public conversation about abuse beyond physical IPV. Because of the often-disconnect between IPV research and what survivors struggle to name as abuse in their daily lives, we sought to understand how IPV discourse was unfolding as a result of the #MaybeHeDoesntHitYou hashtag. <bold> Materials and Methods: </bold> NCapture was used to collect publically available Twitter data containing the hashtag “#MaybeHeDoesntHitYou” from May 10, 2016 to May 17, 2016. Using the Duluth Power and Control Wheel (a range of tactics used by abusers to control and harm their partners) and the Women's Experience with Battering (WEB) framework (emotional and behavioral responses to being abused), we analyzed 1,229 original content tweets using qualitative content analysis. <bold> Results: </bold> All dimensions of the Power and Control Wheel and five of six dimensions of the WEB framework were expressed via #MaybeHeDoesntHitYou; users did not express yearning for intimacy with their abusive partners. Users described one form of IPV not currently represented within the Power and Control Wheel—reproductive coercion ( e.g. , “#MaybeHeDoesntHitYou but he refuses to use condoms and forces you not to use contraception so you try to do it behind his back”). Two additional themes emerged; users challenged the gender pronoun of the hashtag, highlighting that abuse may happen with partners of all genders, and users provided social support for others ( e.g. , “#MaybeHeDoesntHitYou is real. Bruises and scars aren't the only measure of abuse! If this is you, help is there…”). <bold> Conclusions: </bold> Results from our study underscore the potential for social media platforms to be powerful agents for engaging public dialogue about the realities of IPV, as well as a space for seeking and providing social support about this critical women's health issue.

However, the implications of these ubiquitous communication technologies for adolescent's social functioning with peers and academic competence in the classroom are not well understood. In fact, research on adolescents' digital lives has only rarely incorporated direct assessments of adjustment in school environments. The current study addressed these limitations with a school-based data collection. 376 adolescents (Mage = 14.4; 209 girls; including 29.2% Latino/Hispanic, 27.3% White, 28.2% mixed) were recruited from an urban high school and followed for one year. Social reputations were indexed via peer nominations and electronic communication tendencies were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Grade point averages, disciplinary events, and attendance data were obtained from school records. On a cross-sectional basis, frequent use of fashionable social networks (i.e., Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter) was associated with popular-aggressive social reputations, poor achievement, and rule-breaking behavior. E-mail use, in contrast, was associated with academic competence. Longitudinal analyses were less conclusive because the examined constructs were highly stable across the period of data collection. The full pattern of findings indicates that electronic communication patterns can be a powerful marker of academic and social functioning at school.

Using ethnographic data, this paper examines how American teenagers conceptualize the term drama; the relationship between drama and social media; and the implications drama has for understanding contemporary teenage conflict. The emic use of drama distances teens from practices conceptualized by adults as bullying or relational aggression, while acknowledging the role of the audience in social media interactions. Drama also serves to reinforce the conventional gendered norms of high school, perpetrating the systemic undervaluing of feminine subjects and re-inscribing heteronormativity. Understanding how drama operates helps illuminate how widespread use of social media among teenagers has altered dynamics of aggression and conflict.
