In this paper, I focus on one of the many ways propagandistic tools are employed to control the relevant agenda and information being disseminated by both traditional media and online, in other words 'message control'. Message control illustrates one of many steps of normalization of far-right agenda. The concept of 'message control' emerged from the specific propaganda tool developed by the former Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his followers and implies launching and thus controlling select information via weekly press conferences, briefings, personal conversations, back-ground conversations (Hintergrundgespräche), and text messages, and to financially subsidize only those media that reported favorably about the activities of Kurz's government. Thus, a new media logic based on favoritism, nepotism, and clientelism was established and normalized. This stands in contrast to Trumpism, which delegitimized all investigative journalism without explicitly attempting to control it. Former US President Donald Trump constitutes rather a prime example of Löwenthal and Guterman', as he instrumentalized far-right and extreme-right media channels (such as Breitbart or Fox News) and extensively used Twitter to spread systematic disinformation.

Calling out racists reveals some limitations of social justice campaigns,DISCOURSE & SOCIETY,10.1177/0957926520977215,,"Twitter campaigns attacking those who make racist or xenophobic statements are valuable, raising the public profile of opinions that will not tolerate racism in any form. They also indicate how our major institutions are failing to address important matters of social justice. But there is concern that social media, such as Twitter, tends to extremes, moral outrages, lack of nuance and incivility, which shape how issues become represented. In this paper, using Critical Discourse Analysis, we look at three Twitter hashtags calling-out racist behaviour. We ask how racism and anti-racism is represented on these hashtags? We show how these misrepresent fundamental aspects of racism in society, distracting from, what race theorists would argue, is the most important thing these incidents tell us about racism at this present time. The findings have consequences for all such Twitter social justice campaigns.",Twitter; hashtags; POLITICS; FACEBOOK; social justice; Affective communities; call-outs; cancel culture; discourse analysis; incivility; moral outrages; racism,WOS,48,,,,,,,

Particularly, the leader is performed as a persona, such as Trump's 'defiant' and Corbyn's 'ordinary' persona, which authentically embodies the mission to save the people from their own enemies, in this case, the mission of national palingenesis (#MAGA and #DrainTheSwamp) and moral vindication (#ForTheMany), respectively. Central to charismatic performances is an affective dynamic which both renders the claim to authenticity convincing and allow for 'the people' to be enacted as a concrete political subject. It does so, however, not in an ahistorical and presupposition-less manner, as some post-ideological approaches to performativity imply, but through discursively patterned emotions with profound ideological ramifications. Therefore, populism is better understood as a performative ideology which deserves our close analytical attention if we are to understand its progressive-democratic or reactionary-undemocratic potential.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICAL COMMUNICATION; Twitter; ideology; Trump; populism; performativity; PEOPLE; Authenticity; BREXIT; charisma; Corbyn; emotion; intertextuality; PARTY; TRUMP; UKIP,WOS,41,,,,,,,

Practices such as mentioning and retweeting have also been discussed in the literature but the practice of following as a discourse practice is underexplored. This article presents a corpus-based Critical Discourse Analytical approach to the study of collective identity on Twitter that focuses on the relationships between following and language use and details a study conducted on the language used by followers of the Football Lads Alliance - a protest group who say they are 'against all extremism'. This approach was fruitful in identifying correlations between salient discourses in follower profile descriptions and their tweets and suggests that a portion of the followership constructs identity in relation to radical right-wing and populist discourse specifically concerning Islam/Muslims.,Twitter; identity; social media; Community of Practice; Corpus Linguistics; corpus-based Critical Discourse Analysis; corpus-based Critical Discourse Studies; Discourse Analysis; discourse communities; LINGUISTICS,WOS,12,,,,,,,

Here, narrative linearity emerges as a tool to observe the borrowing of Twitter hashtags in several journalistic pieces. It is contended that the linearity of authorship, narration and representation of time appears as a satisfactory pathway to trace the development of hashtags into popular news stories. Results suggested that hashtags can significantly follow narratives and agendas in journalism but differing from their original social media context.",MEDIA; social media; Arab Spring; Brazil; Journalism; JOURNALISTS; narrative linearity,WOS,2,,,,,,,

A mixed-methods approach was designed. First, we used quantitative semantic analysis to compare the large datasets of tweets about female and male MPs, with a view to detecting possible gendered patterns. We then triangulated our quantitative findings with an in-depth critical discursive analysis of the tweets mentioning female MPs. Rather than showing gendered patterns across the board, the results from the quantitative analysis brought out large inter-individual differences. Some female MPs received comments containing more lexis related to appearance, sexual history and violence, as well as more emotional or extreme language. Critical analysis of the hostile and abusive messages targeting women reveals them to be deeply embedded in a social perception of women's political activity as breaching the rules of gender performativity.",2019 UK elections; cyberviolence; gender and politics; online hostility; semantic analysis; social media critical discourse studies; UK politics,WOS,3,,,,,,,

The growth of this type of discourse has been supported by the expansion of social media, which have been proven to act as a mechanism for the propagation of crimes against targets such as migrants and refugees, one of the main affected groups. That is why we have conducted the first European study of the social acceptance of migrants and refugees by studying the presence of hate speech. The research is based on the perspective of the theories of intergroup contact and mediated intergroup contact. The methodology includes large-scale longitudinal analysis (2015-2020) of online hate speech on Twitter (N=847,978) and its contrast with existing official indicators. The results suggest that personal intergroup contact is positively corretaled with the support of the local population towards migrants and refugees but mediated intergroup contact is not correlated with hate speech on Twitter. We found evidence that those regions where the support for foreigners was higher, there was a lower level of hate speech on Twitter. This is an advance in the study of hate speech by territories and can help in the formulation of action strategies.

It poses an alternative to the classical notion of crowd by addressing gatherings in digital rather than physical space. Researching online crowds assumes individual participation to be additive as inferred from tweets grouped around hashtags in microblogging. However, tweets may be understood as a type of inter-textual communication rather than spontaneous displays of emotion. It suggests that online gatherings inferred from these displays do not necessarily reflect the transformation of digital connectivity into crowds. Instead, digitally connected individuals assert their individuality to become members of a swarm. Compared with networks and multitudes, swarms do not separate the parts from the whole to imply a type of collectivism that subsists on the contradiction of the individualized whole. Online crowds are, therefore, not crowds per se but an instance of swarming where digital connectivity provides rationalized conditions for individual thoughts, feelings and actions to be grouped into convergent activities resembling self-organization without central control.

Methods: The 10 alcohol brands per country with the greatest Twitter presence were identified based on the number of 'followers'. Number of tweets, photos, and videos were collected and the type of content noted for each brand between 1 January 2016 and 29 February 2016. The data were analysed via an inductive coding approach using NVivo10. Results: In total, the brands had accumulated up to 150,386 followers (Indian: 110,032; Australian: 40,354). The techniques utilised were a mix of those that differed by country (e.g. India: sexually suggestive content versus Australia: posts related to the brand's tradition or heritage) and generic approaches (e.g. alcohol sponsorship of sport, music, and fashion; offering consumption suggestions; organising competitions; giveaways; and use of memes). Conclusions: The flexibility of Twitter, which complements traditional marketing, allows brands to adapt and deliver their online alcohol content in specific national contexts and to capitalise on the cultural meanings users invoke in their interactions with the brands.

Design and methods: Internet-based survey analysed using a two-stage factor analysis protocol and internal consistency (IC) assessment. Findings: A power calculation was made on the basis of pilot data and this established that 317 interviewees were required to test the reliability of the HDAS.

Subscale 1 was also found to have acceptable IC whereas subscale 2 exhibited sub-optimal IC characteristics. Conclusions: This initial study indicates that the HDAS has promise as a measure of the individuals' rationale for home drinking.
