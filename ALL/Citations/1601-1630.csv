In particular, we analyzed how participation in a specific campaign and use of hashtags connected to the campaign developed over time and what kind of sub-flows of tweets or spinoff conversations emerged. The campaign hashtag that we observed later appeared in connection to sharing of an article that was not directly connected to the original campaign. Although both the original campaign and this sub-flow of it were connected to the broader context of climate change, the sub-flow formed a separate community of tweeters that did not overlap with tweeters participating in the original campaign. Twitter campaigns have flexible boundaries both around the shared issues and around the communities of tweeters. Our results show that using information spreading approach does not account for the evolution of campaign spreading on Twitter, as other factors, such as celebrity endorsement, may heavily influence the spread of information and content on Twitter. Thus, our results suggest that although different tweeters participated in the two separate campaigns using shared hashtags, hashtags per se do not always indicate shared communities of tweeters nor can they always be considered as indicators of completely shared issues online.",,SAGE,15,,,,,,,

Drawing on the ecological model of communication, this study analyzed the latest 71,913 tweets from 40 SEAs that had official Twitter accounts. The results of correlation analysis indicate no significant relationship between the SEAs’ presence on Twitter and the SEAs’ targeted Twitter users, denoting that the SEAs’ well-intentioned efforts in communicating with stakeholders and the public by using Twitter might fall short of the public’s preferable medium for receiving information. In addition, the results of content analysis suggest that the SEAs primarily used Twitter for one-way asymmetrical information broadcasting, leaving Twitter’s two-way symmetrical communication functionality largely untapped. Findings are discussed with respect to the implications for educational organizations’ effective use of Twitter through the public’s increased participation and collaboration.",,SAGE,21,,,,,,,

We classify social media users’ preferences over the two U.S. presidential candidates in the 2016 election using Twitter data and explore the topics of conversation among proClinton and proTrump supporters. We take advantage of hashtags that signaled users’ vote preferences to train our machine learning model which employs a novel classifier—a Topic-Based Naive Bayes model—that we demonstrate improves on existing classifiers. Our findings demonstrate that we are able to classify users with a high degree of accuracy and precision. We further explore the similarities and divergences among what proClinton and proTrump users discussed on Twitter.",,SAGE,12,,,,,,,

Yet, many of these conversations can be either acrimoniously unpleasant or pleasantly uninformative. Why do we seek out and engage in these interactions? Who do people choose to argue with, and what brings them back to repeated exchanges? In short, why do people bother arguing online? We develop a model of argument engagement using a new dataset of Twitter conversations about President Trump. The model incorporates numerous user, tweet, and thread-level features to predict user participation in conversations with over 98% accuracy. We find that users are likely to argue over wide ideological divides, and are increasingly likely to engage with those who are different from themselves. In addition, we find that the emotional content of a tweet has important implications for user engagement, with negative and unpleasant tweets more likely to spark sustained participation. Although often negative, these extended discussions can bridge political differences and reduce information bubbles. This suggests a public appetite for engaging in prolonged political discussions that are more than just partisan potshots or trolling, and our results suggest a variety of strategies for extending and enriching these interactions.",,SAGE,34,,,,,,,

Such impacts are increasingly linked to a growing socio-spatial inequality and have served to politicise civil society's relationship with both platforms and tourism. As the more extractive platforms project themselves as sustainable, equitable ""alternatives"" to traditional accommodation business models, social protest and resistance collectives are increasingly vocal in projecting digital counter-narratives to this vision. This study analyses the impacts of Airbnb on the city of Barcelona and contextualises them within the digitally-networked narratives and counter-narratives that surround them. Different theoretical perspectives on traditional and digital activism are used to frame, on the one hand, the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings and on the other, an in-depth content analysis of Twitter conversations mentioning ""Airbnb"" and ""Barcelona"". Findings show that the Airbnb effect reinforces broader touristification processes, mainly in relation to housing access and affordability issues and residential displacement. In parallel, digital counter-narratives underline this process and call for regulatory intervention. Both resistance and advocacy narratives tend to be ""choreographed"" by a range of actors other than Airbnb itself; particularly online press outlets, individual activists and political decision-makers.",MEDIA; PATTERNS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; HOME; TWITTER; TOURISM; Airbnb; Collaborative platforms; digital counter-narratives; social protest and resistance movements; socio-spatial inequality,WOS,29,,,,,,,

Increasing numbers of events are being attended by international travellers. In this paper, we use mobile positioning data (call detail records (CDR)) to focus on visits made to Estonia over the period 2006-2013. The aim is to compare the characteristics of visits to megastar concerts with visits to other events (entertainment events, festivals, and sporting events) and regular visits. The dataset consists of 853,013 visits by 497,038 visitors. The results show a correlation between the distance travelled by an individual and the likelihood of attending a megastar concert. Visitors to megastar concerts are more likely to come from neighbouring countries and to spend less time in a destination than visitors to other events or regular visitors. The geography of visits to megastar concerts differs from that of other types of visits; on average, visitors to megastar concerts travel less within Estonia than other groups of visitors. These results indicate that the hosting of this type of event helps to diversify the supply of tourism in Estonia. It is also clear that mobile positioning data are a valuable source in studies of event tourism.",IMPACT; DISTANCE; TWITTER; DESTINATIONS; Estonia; EVENT TOURISM; megastar concert; mobile positioning; MOTIVES; MUSIC; PLACE ATTACHMENT; Planned events; POSITIONING DATA; tourism; VISITORS,WOS,2,,,,,,,

The victims of this phenomenon are women for the simple fact that their aggressors do not recognize their minimum rights of freedom, respect and decisionmaking. At the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, the UN acknowledged that violence against women is an obstacle to achieving equality, development and peace and that it violates and violates human rights and fundamental freedoms. The UN defines the phenomenon as a manifestation of power relations between women and men that, as history shows us, have always been unequal. Social media, it comes in a variety of forms from the most popular like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to things like blogs, business networks and forums. Those who are active online within these social media platforms each and every month reach into billions of users. Accessibility is also becoming easier, as everyone can now connect via a mobile device. The reason behind social media, why do people share? First, many want to share the content they find, because it is entertaining or the information has value. Social media helps connect people, as well as helping to grow businesses. Another reason includes people using social media for causes and charities, sharing these because they feel strongly about a certain issue. This brings us to how social media can have an impact on the community and general society. Many of the problems in the world today have more exposure, therefore bringing increased awareness of issues. This is definitely a positive side to social media, but is there also a downside?

When the pandemic forced a cessation of physical demonstrations in March, we employed a mixed-methods research design combining manual and automatic classification of tweets with qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interviews, in order to illuminate both how the independence movement responded to the pandemic in organizational and strategic terms, as well as providing a reflection of how activists reflected on the purposes and context of their activities. We conceptualise the cessation of activities as a period of 'abeyance' and ask how Scottish independence activists worked to stay mobilized during lockdowns. We found that the movement utilized a variety of strategies, including online events, and by framing independence as a response to these crises. In pointing to the mishandling of the pandemic by the Conservative government in Westminster, and the oncoming end of the Brexit transition period, for example, activists were able to emphasise the importance and urgency of the movement's cause.

Accused of transphobia, he was denounced by a prominent atheist organization, which led to intense arguments in Anglophone atheist spaces on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, lasting throughout the year. This article uses the controversy, an instance ""YouTube drama,"" as an opportunity to investigate the ways in which an imagined ""atheist community"" is constructed through internal atheist conflict. Through critical discourse analysis of 157 YouTube videos, published between the end of March and the end of November, it identifies six different discursive formations, which affected the development of the drama and offer competing conceptions of the community. By utilizing Michael Warner's theory of 'publics' and tounterpublics,' spaces that exists only for the circulation of discourse, this study approaches the drama not as an interpersonal conflict, but as a battle over the norms of discourse within the atheist community. It suggests that a public lens is useful for understanding contemporary atheism, and that the nature of publics and counterpublics helps explain the dynamics of atheist disagreement on social issues.",YouTube; drama; RELIGION; atheism; publics; transphobia,WOS,0,,,,,,,

It explores the character and seeming purposes of the perpetuation of menstrual prohibitions and stereotypes in a global publication medium that allows unregulated self-expression. A social constructionist perspective, however, suggests that ready access to multiple realities in a transparent media environment might influence or alter how menstruation is positioned within various communities of knowledge.

We argue that online aggression toward women aims to reinforce traditional feminine norms and stereotypes. In a mixed methods study, we find that this type of aggression on Twitter is common and extensive and that it can spread far beyond the original target. We locate over 2.9 million tweets in one week that contain instances of gendered insults (e.g., ""bitch,"" ""cunt,"" ""slut,"" or ""whore"")—averaging 419,000 sexist slurs per day. The vast majority of these tweets are negative in sentiment. We analyze the social networks of the conversations that ensue in several cases and demonstrate how the use of ""replies,"" ""retweets,"" and ""likes"" can further victimize a target. Additionally, we develop a sentiment classifier that we use in a regression analysis to compare the negativity of sexist messages. We find that words in a message that reinforce feminine stereotypes inflate the negative sentiment of tweets to a significant and sizeable degree. These terms include those insulting someone's appearance (e.g., ""ugly""), intellect (e.g., ""stupid""), sexual experience (e.g., ""promiscuous""), mental stability (e.g., ""crazy""), and age (""old""). Messages enforcing beauty norms tend to be particularly negative. In sum, hostile, sexist tweets are strategic in nature. They aim to promote traditional, cultural beliefs about femininity, such as beauty ideals, and they shame victims by accusing them of falling short of these standards.

An analysis of 396 instances (comprising 1061 individual tweets) of the use of the phrase ""no homo"" on the social media platform Twitter suggests that the phrase is a gendered epithet that conveys cultural norms about masculinity. The first finding is that the phrase is used more often by male tweeters than by female tweeters. The second, as predicted by the literature on homophobia, is that the phrase is used in a negative emotional context to convey disapproval for men's homosexuality or behavior that is not gender normative. The third finding is that the modal use of the phrase ""no homo"" is in a positive emotional context, accompanying expressions of men's pleasure, desire, affection, attachment, and friendship. Our analysis suggests that the phrase ""no homo"" is a gendered one, primarily used by men to facilitate a particularly masculinized construction of positive emotional expression. Our research adds to and complicates findings on the relationship between homophobia and masculinity that suggests that homophobia is an organizing principal of masculinity in western cultures.

Selfies display their subject's face or body to social media followers and friends, making them particularly appearance-oriented images. As with other social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, Instagram posts garner feedback in the form of ""likes"" and comments from online audiences. When applied to selfies, such feedback can be interpreted as aggregated evaluations of their subject's physical appearance. We employ objectification theory to explore how value placed on selfie feedback among young women relates to markers of body image disturbance, including body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and bulimia action tendencies. We conducted an online survey of 177 English-speaking young adult (18–30 years-old) female Instagram users who were recruited through MTurk and who post selfies to examine the relationship between investment in selfie feedback and body image disturbance. We found that women who reported higher investment in selfie feedback were more likely to express body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness through the indirect influence of body surveillance, but this effect did not extend to bulimic tendencies. Our findings suggest that young adult female Instagram users who value audience responses to their selfies are more likely to exhibit disordered eating attitudes and intentions.

Automated analyses that disregard such a pro-social function may, contrary to their intended design, actually reinforce harmful biases. This paper uses 'Perspective', an AI technology developed by Jigsaw (formerly Google Ideas), to measure the levels of toxicity of tweets from prominent drag queens in the United States. The research indicated that Perspective considered a significant number of drag queen Twitter accounts to have higher levels of toxicity than white nationalists. The qualitative analysis revealed that Perspective was not able to properly consider social context when measuring toxicity levels and failed to recognize cases in which words, that might conventionally be seen as offensive, conveyed different meanings in LGBTQ speech.

The construct validity and applicability vary vastly among these scales. This paper introduces, therefore, a new index for measuring individual pornographic interests and underpins the literature of pornography. It also defines the necessary procedures required for compiling a dynamic lexicon of pornography, based on linguistic, cognitive and ontological facets, to allow for the development and evaluation of an Individual Pornographic Index (IPI). Such an index is ushered to replace the fidelity of a speaker (patient/applicant) by the fidelity of the spoken/written discourse (e.g., tweets and posts). WordNet and FrameNet are used to introduce all the semantically-related content words; boosting the selectional restrictions. Web-based exploration of online writings and database is also enabled to fetch the pertinent colloquial and slang pornographic lexical entries. Having compiling such a set of data, a working definition of 'pornography' is suggested. Results suggest that computational linguistics can be useful in measuring pornographic indices of individual written discourses. Moreover, WordNet's definition of pornography needs to be revisited and so do its ontolexical relations. Interoperability between Web, WordNet and FrameNet is fruitful in enriching the ontolexical seeds of this introduced lexicon and in suggesting several missing frames in FrameNet.

This event led to a mass Twitter protest in the country. Women across the country started sharing the hashtag #sendeanlat (""#tellyourstory"" in English). In the current exploratory study, 164,279 original tweets were analyzed using the text analytic approach called the Meaning Extraction Method. Results revealed the key themes of reactions to victim blaming, honor culture/namus, assault experiences, social media, and women's responsibility. Policy, media, and mental-health-related implications and future research directions are discussed.

What do feminists do in a global moment when antifeminist backlash emerges with fervor in politics, policy, and social spaces to reverse and challenge feminist progress? Rage happens. This article explores the role of rage in the development of African feminist digital counterpublics on Twitter. Through two Twitter hashtags, #MenAreTrash and #JusticeForSharon, I illuminate how anger emanating from increasing rates of femicide in Kenya and South Africa catalyzes the evolution of feminist communities of knowledge, solidarity, and resistance on Twitter. The rage illustrated in this article is considered in relation to longer histories of burnout and fatigue with nonresponse from the state and from male allies. Through these digital spaces, a process of building alliances and challenging antifeminist movements emerges. Feminist engagements around these hashtags are a site of concrete resistance against online misogyny as well as its material manifestations through femicide. In a context where antifeminist movements see digital spaces as sites to mobilize antifeminist sentiment, paying attention to digital feminist counterpublics is critical to understanding gender justice and freedom.

Specifically, we are interested in on- and offline activism that challenges norms of gendered violence and is led by young feminists. These protests were among those that received the widest media coverage in 2015 and 2016, shaping public discourse against sexual violence in South Africa. We focus here on three protests that included the use of Twitter hashtags—#RapeAtAzania, #RUReferencelist, and #RememberKhwezi—indicating a new reliance among young, educated feminists on social media for organizational, informational, and activist purposes. Using media articles and Twitter posts related to these hashtags, we analyze the ways and means through which some young feminists speak out against sexual violence in South Africa today. We ask how these new types of actions might interact with existing antiviolence and feminist movements in South Africa. Although sexual violence has long plagued South African society, young feminists today are engaging and identifying with this highly politicized issue on personal grounds. Via social media they reveal their own encounters with sexual violence, expose silences that accompany rape, and call for an ""unforgetting"" of the stories of rape survivors.

The event caught the imagination of XR protesters worldwide, with a video of the action being watched over one million times on Twitter. On 6 December that year a 'Global Discobedience' event was held where the protest was reproduced in over 20 countries on the same day. This paper will present an exploratory examination of why the Discobedience has struck such a chord and become so popular within the movement, using the event as a lens through which to explore the possibilities offered by the mode of protesting it represents. It will use the concept of 'bad environmentalism', as developed by Nicole Seymour, to frame the action as one that offers a potential destabilisation and queering of time and makes thinking differently about the future possible in new ways. It will argue that the musical choice of 'Stayin' Alive', and the cultural memories it evokes, are central to this possibility.
