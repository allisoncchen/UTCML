The purpose of the present study was to identify and discuss Ban the Box-related themes in a sample of Twitter posts. Using the social media platform Twitter, researchers collected a 58-day sample of public posts that used the hashtag Ban the Box (#BantheBox). A qualitative thematic analysis was used to assess the content of tweets to identify underlying themes related to the Ban the Box movement. Two researchers independently coded the contents of each original tweet (N=204) and reached consensus on identified themes. Results showed two underlying themes: first, risky business or the perceived risks businesses take in hiring persons with prior justice system involvement, and second, that individuals with prior justice system involvement are a vulnerable population. This study highlights how Twitter is used to communicate about social justice-related issues. Further, this paper serves as a call to action for policymakers, social workers, and researchers to consider this medium when advocating for individuals with prior justice system involvement.

Employing social network analysis and sentiment analysis, this study investigates the Twitter-mediated communication behaviors among cryptocurrencies. This study determines whether a significant association exists between cryptocurrencies' Twitter networks and their credit scores. Data were drawn from the Twitter pages of several top cryptocurrencies. The results indicate that reply-mention networks had the densest structure, that the following-follower network structure was correlated with the reply-mention structure, and that the reply-mention and co-tweet networks were positively correlated. The results also indicate that cryptocurrencies' active networking strategies affected their credit scores and more importantly, that cryptocurrencies frequently linked with fellow currencies tended to have high credit scores.

In this article, we adopt a process perspective and argue that data extracted from socio-technical systems are, in principle, subject to the same error-inducing mechanisms as traditional forms of social science data, namely biases that arise before their acquisition (observational design), during their acquisition (data generation), and after their acquisition (data processing). As the lack of access and insight into the actual processes of data production renders key traditional mechanisms of quality assurance largely impossible, it is essential to identify data quality problems in the data available-that is, to focus on the possibilities post-hoc quality assessment offers to us. We advance a post-hoc strategy of data quality assurance, integrating simulation and explorative identification techniques. As a use case, we illustrate this approach with the example of bot activity and the effects this phenomenon can have on digital process data. First, we employ agent-based modelling to simulate datasets containing these data problems. Subsequently, we demonstrate the possibilities and challenges of post-hoc control by mobilizing geometric data analysis, an exemplary technique for identifying data quality issues.",Data quality; BEHAVIOR; TWITTER; TROLLS; Agent-based simulations; BIG DATA.; Digital process data; Mixed methods; Post-hoc identification; Relational data; Socio-technical systems,WOS,3,,,,,,,

By combining online ethnography and big data approaches, we see that online far right extremism in Europe is active and ranks are growing, while Islamist extremism has been incapacitated in sharing controversial forms of expression. We describe how the far right uses Twitter as a means for political activism, while Islamist extremists offer lifestyle information, related to local branches of faith, using Twitter as a storefront that re-routes users to other platforms. We consider resources for action, notably on the far right. World leaders influence followers online and support a global conversation between users that paves the way to a far right European milieu thriving on Twitter. To conclude, we delve into the notions of radicalisation and political participation to emphasise the asymmetry between the two forms of media participation in respect to academic discourses and big tech and States' practises.

Does the fact that social media empower journalists to provide journalism in more ways than one through tweets, postings, and video and photo uploads, enhance journalists' freedom of expression and, in a wider sense, the freedom of the press?

There are different debates about a potential overrepresentation of some of these exploitation purposes, such as the sexual one, in the discourses underlying international regulations, news or institutional campaigns. This may have consequences on the identification of some of the population affected by this phenomenon and the assistance provided to them. The aim of this paper is to analyse the temporal evolution of the purposes of exploitation, actors and topics most represented in the activity on human trafficking and exploitation on Twitter during the 2011-2020 period. The results show that sexual exploitation is the purpose most represented in Twitter activity and the fact that international organisations and the criminal prosecution of the crime of human trafficking have progressively become more relevant. Furthermore, the networks of topics suggest that sexual exploitation seems to be linked to the notion of prostitution. This may have consequences for the displacement of other purposes of exploitation or the approaches centred on the promotion of human rights to less relevant positions, as well as for the construction of certain images of victims of human trafficking.

Through a corpus-based analysis, we show how the meaning of #jesuis broadened from expressing condolence and support following terrorist attacks over expressing condolence for other (violent) deaths to a more general marker of solidarity and alignment. This broadening of meaning is parallel to a formal evolution of the stem jesuis. Moreover, these hashtags have become emblematic of a particular kind of Twitter user. Furthermore, disaligning uses developed, including mocking uses, which disalign both with certain causes (disalignment de re) and with the process of using jesuis as a means of expressing solidarity (disalignment de dicto). Thus, this variety of uses shows that Twitter users exploit the interpersonal possibilities of hashtags to express alignment and disalignment, creating ambient affiliation.

In this article, I discuss the linguistic stance-taking moves that Lady Gaga uses in two different communicative media in order to construct an authentic celebrity persona. Through references to intimate relationships, inclusive plural pronouns, and demonstration of attention to fan conversations, Lady Gaga's Twitter posts create a stance of alignment with the ordinary' people in her fan base. Conversely, by using combative and corrective rhetorical strategies in interviews with journalists, she creates a stance of disalignment with mass media establishment. Together, these linguistic strategies allow Lady Gaga's claims to authenticity to be seen as morally credible.

Existing research, however, focuses upon face-to-face behaviours, and to date the nature of abuse in online spaces has been overlooked. It is becoming ever more apparent that virtual environments create optimal climates for abuse to occur due to the ability for individuals to communicate in an instantaneous, uncontrolled and often anonymous manner in virtual worlds.

For this reason, this paper investigates how practitioners may measure brand equity of their seaports by performing social media sentiment analysis. Another aim of this study is to find whether the social media statistics are good enough to measure the success of the port brand equity. Sentiment analysis is employed to assess a sample of 63.699 tweets by 45 seaports, selected from Europe, Middle East, Far East Asia, and America.

For many people, SM is reshaping their social world, rewriting the rules of social engagement and sociability. The use of SM has grown drastically in the past decade. Referring to the data released by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), more than half of the population are internet users and more than 90 percent of the internet users visit social networking platforms as their online activities. Referring to the same data, most of the internet users are between the age of 20s to 40s. Despite the drastic changes in SM uses, many ethical and social issues arise. The critical issues that occur in the existence of SM among others are the spread of fake news, online harassment, privacy issues, and cyberbullies. Therefore, this research aims to gain some insights into the ethical and social issues in SM among university students in Malaysia. Ethnography will be the qualitative approach for the study whereby this approach is the best approach to study people in their own environment through the use of methods such as participant observation and face-to-face interviewing. The research will apply purposive sampling as an approach to seek subjects who have some specific knowledge or expertise relevant to the topic. In other words, they are rich in the information needed for this study. Online interviews will be conducted as a method for data collection from twenty-eight (28) students from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The data will be analysed using thematic analysis whereby Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel (since most higher education institutions (HEIs) have Microsoft licenses for both faculty and students to use the Microsoft Office 365 suite) will be used as a tool to code and organise the key point and themes. The thematic analysis is a data analysis process in which themes and relationships are established by identifying statements or phrases of the data. This research involved six phases, from; i) familiarization the data set from both respondents and moderators, and ii) generating systematic codes, by identifying the relevant data within the data set, and iii) tagging the data with specific phrases or words. Next, iv) process the pattern formation, and v) identification of the first version of theme development. Theme development involves examining codes and combining, clustering, or collapsing the codes together into bigger or more meaningful patterns. Finally, vi) generate and review the top five key points per theme in addition to the key points related to the research. The approach integrates a widely used application software suite for organizing, coding, and classifying data. The features that Microsoft Excel offers as a tool to organize the key points or themes, crucially do not require advanced knowledge of the software. This research will emphasize the importance of the data analysis step in increasing the validity and reliability of findings and outline a method of analysis that is accessible to the researchers.

Research consistently has shown that U.S. journalists rely on official sources such as governmental or business elites in reporting the news and that ordinary citizens and alternative voices are not well represented. Some scholars have theorized that social media platforms such as Twitter might disrupt journalistic norms, leading to greater source diversity in news reports. A content analysis of stories appearing in the three newspapers (N = 1,085) finds that the journalists' use of tweets as news sources differed little from traditional sourcing practices. Tweets from politicians were cited most frequently while the tweets of non-official sources were rarely cited, a trend that grew more pronounced over time. Furthermore, the tweets generally were not featured prominently within the stories. Journalists at the three newspapers appear to have normalized Twitter to fit existing norms and reporting practices.

An analysis of tweets during the Boston Marathon bombing and the Brussels Airport attack finds that institutional and audience frames show similarity but do not always converge on Twitter. Similarities in the audience and institutional frames are attributed to a universal human tendency for social categorization, inherent in the minds of not only ordinary citizens but also journalists. Proximity effects, however, were more salient on audience frames than on institutional frames.

Across two preregistered experimental designs, we empirically examine the effect that President Trump's tweets containing ""fake news"" accusations toward journalists have on how audiences perceive news stories. Our first study showed no direct effect of exposure to ""fake news"" tweets on outcomes. In our second study, we found users who read more fake news tweets rated a story about Hurricane Maria victims and its author as more credible, showed greater transportation into the story, experienced higher levels of meaningful affect, indicated more favorable views toward providing more aid to Puerto Ricans, and had greater intentions to consume more news in the future.

This study uses an experimental design to isolate two features of a headline shared on Twitter to determine the impact on audience ratings of 'news-ness.' We examine how people rate a Twitter post about potential government shutdown depending on: the type of story headline (breaking, exclusive, fact check, opinion), and the source of the story/tweet (Associated Press, MSNBC, Fox News). Results show that headline story type and source separately impact news-ness, with partisanship conditioning the influence of source on news-ness. Moreover, we find that ratings of news-ness mediate these effects on intent to verify tweet content, such that higher ratings of news-ness results in lower intent to verify. We argue that more attention needs to be paid to the central role that perceptions of news-ness plays in driving a range of outcomes in today's social media environment.

Given that the news media, at times, obsesses over relatively trivial matters, and given that the audience is increasingly able to filter media exposure, it is worth asking what happens when audience members perceive that recent media coverage has not emphasized any very important problems. In such cases, audience members might assume that any problems facing the nation must not be particularly important. We explicate this attitude of political complacency, test whether perceived media agendas lacking important problems can influence it, and explore whether complacency helps explain political disengagement. We also explore whether these effects generalize beyond news, to new media gatekeepers such as Twitter. Two experiments tested effects of a perceived absence of important problems in recent news or Twitter content. In the case of news, but not Twitter, this increased complacency in both studies. Study 2 added a no-exposure control and found that effects on complacency were driven by the cueing of nonproblem stories, not by the absence of problem story cues. Both studies validated complacency as a predictor of political disengagement.
