Journalists from the publicly held newspapers engage with audiences more on social media than privately held newspapers. The more journalists engage on Twitter, the more they tend to have a negative attitude toward social media.

By September, Sephora announced it was cancelling the product after receiving extensive criticism on social media, particularly from Modern Witches. This article examines the uproar surrounding Sephora's Starter Witch Kit as it played out on Twitter. The debate on Twitter included Witches protesting the appropriation and commodification of their sacred traditions, as well as outsiders who questioned the right of Witches to complain about spiritual theft. This Twitter debate was an opportunity for Modern Witches to substantiate and legitimize their identities as Witches. Witches distinguished their identities as ""authentic"" by mocking certain products and consumers, and demarcated practices/traditions as distinctive of Witchcraft by calling them sacred. By accusing Sephora of spiritual theft, Witches also largely elided their own engagement with appropriation from religious traditions.

The political efficacy of testing is traced through two mini-case studies: the Philippines and the United States. The case studies follow the approach of populism scholars in drawing from various sources that 'render the populist style visible' from the tweets and press releases of government officials to media reportage. Using the framework of medical populism, the case studies pay attention to the ways in which coronavirus testing figured in (1) simplification of the pandemic; (2) spectacularization of the crisis; (3) forging of divisions; and (4) invocation of knowledge claims. Identifying and critically analyzing how knowledge is generated is an essential step to recognizing the impact that political styles have on the COVID pandemic. The political actors in each case study have shaped knowledge of the epidemic, in the way they construct the idea of 'testing', and in how they mobilize testing as an 'evidence-making practice'. Their actions shaped how the pandemic--as well as their responses--is measured. This framework contributes to public policy debates by providing evidence of the impact of medical populism on pandemic response efforts.

This enabled us to meet the main objective of the study, which was to verify whether the Instagram platform is prone to hosting political messages and discussions of a populist nature. Likewise, in order to obtain a wider perspec-tive of both campaigns on the same social network, the issues forming the subject of each candidates' agendas in the same period were studied. The main results show that Instagram, like Twitter and Facebook, enables political leaders to spread messages that in essence carry a populist narrative; to use the social network as a means of electoral propaganda; and largely to avoid discussing the proposals of their political agendas.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICAL COMMUNICATION; political leaders; FACEBOOK; populism; DISCOURSE; social networks; MEDIATIZATION; PARTIES; TWITTER; IMAGE; DISCURSIVE STRATEGY; general elections; GENERAL-ELECTION; thematic agenda,WOS,0,,,,,,,

Proposing the notion of a distributed fandom affinity space, we explore parents' discourse on Twitter around the commonly adopted hashtag #Bluey and discern several fundamental categories of posts that provide insight into child and metarecipient parent fandom in the #Bluey affinity space. The tweets revolve around the concepts of parenting, family life, education and language that arise from watching Bluey, which both parents and children evaluate in positive terms.

The study involves an observation of the website and Facebook group of the Flemish reading initiative ledereenleest.be (EverybodyReads.be), and includes in-depth interviews with highly active participants. We introduce the concept of affinity spaces to develop our understanding of how readers engage in a variety of literary practices within social media environments dedicated to literature and reading. Based on a qualitative thematic analysis of the interview data we discuss four ways in which users characterize literary and social media practices. As such, the study provides insight into readers' understanding and appreciation of the social aspects of participating in literary culture within social media environments. It also shows how they perceive and negotiate their role within these environments. The image presented by the participants confirms the characterization of social media as affinity spaces and stresses the crucial importance of acknowledging, supporting and encouraging people's passions and interests by allowing engagement in a variety of literary practices.

It aims to understand the different affective and cognitive dynamics that are associated with the online sharing of cultural heritage in difficult times. To do so, we analyzed two Instagram hashtags-#ShareOurHeritage and #ShareCulture - that are promoted by UNESCO on a global scale. We applied a comprehensive quantitative method for qualitative data analysis. This method relied on Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling to generate automated induction of semantic topics and understand the underlying cognitive and affective dimensions of Instagram posts under each topic. Social values- including safety, inclusion, participation, and resilience - positive emotional language, and diverse cultural expressions were the most shared by the investigated hashtag community during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, results showed that users approach the virtual space as a substitute for the loss of their physical place through terms like home, virtual, online, travel tomorrow, and museums from home. Results are discussed in the context of the global digital divide, the social value of heritage to hashtag communities, and the use of Instagram as a longitudinal record of how cultural heritage values change across time.",Social media; SOCIAL MEDIA; COVID-19; FACEBOOK; WEB 2.0; GRATIFICATIONS; EXPERIENCES; TWITTER; PHOTOS; TRAVEL; DIGITAL DIVIDE; Hashtag community; Heritage values; Sharing; TRAUMA,WOS,19,,,,,,,
