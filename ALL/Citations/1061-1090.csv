Organizations utilize social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flicker, Google Plus, and YouTube to promote their product, service, or brand worldwide. Increase of consumer engagement in online social activities has forced companies to integrate social media factors into their marketing strategy. The objective of this study is to find the important factors on which the online purchasing decision depends, based on the personality types of consumers and their attitude toward social media with brand perception.

It answers the following research question: 'To what extent has the ICC used Twitter to facilitate dialogue and exchange with its stakeholders as opposed to one-way information provision?' Literary research and the descriptive analysis of 1,712 tweets and retweets published by @IntlCrimCourt between November 2017 and June 2019 reveal that the ICC primarily used Twitter to provide information and build support among its most powerful stakeholders. Notwithstanding its stated commitment to two-way stakeholder communication, the ICC made little to no effort to solicit feedback or generate dialogue on Twitter. These findings reveal the opportunities and limitations of Twitter as a mechanism to communicate with stakeholders and highlight the difficult position the ICC finds itself in as an international judicial institution dependent on state support.

Thanks to an active community of online commentators made up primarily of academics, researchers, staff of non-governmental organizations and journalists, Twitter is a vibrant place to monitor the pulse of international criminal law generally and the International Criminal Court specifically. Twitter, thus, uniquely elevates a comparatively small commentator class and amplifies their narratives about the field of international criminal justice. Yet with an apparent lack of voices from across the diverse community of practitioners, or the input of diplomats and technocrats who make the field possible, commentators may exert a disproportionate influence over public perceptions of international criminal justice. Cognisant of the stark interplay between politics and law in international criminal justice — often including powerful forces with nefarious agendas — and an abundance of individuals motivated by a desire to be seen and heard, this community may at times exhibit problematic behaviours (unwittingly or otherwise). This article dissects these issues of online communication, and argues that greater care with commentary may be the best salve to these cultural flaws in the formation of public perception.

While this categorisation does not presuppose discrimination in itself, it appears to be a precondition for discursive discrimination. COVID-19 age-related risks have particularly exacerbated ageism on social media, fuelling discourses driven by intergenerational tension. Despite the importance of social media in contemporary communication, there is still scant research on the representation of ageism in these environments. This paper attempts to fill this void by exploring millennials' use of the derogatory Twitter hashtags #BoomerDoomer and #BoomerRemover to discriminate 'baby boomers' as the COVID-19 risk group. Informed by Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) showing interest in discriminatory discourse in the media, the study aims at disclosing the main themes and discursive strategies used to construe ageist content in a sample of original tweets posted during the initial stage of the disease outbreak when the hashtags were trending. Framed by a CDA taxonomy of discriminatory discursive strategies, the combined thematic and discourse analysis highlights how the chosen topics and discursive strategies subtly perpetuate ageism, thus suggesting its resurgence in the COVID-19 era.

Many individuals with different transgender identities might lay claim to lesbian identity or lesbian discourse(s) more generally. However, this inclusion has been disputed in some circles insofar as it is seen to challenge or contradict characteristics of lesbianism. This paper explores how transgender discourses might challenge and (re)politicize lesbianism and lesbian identities. Given that social media platforms concentrate minority communities in one space and can serve to exacerbate antagonism over identities, I focus in this paper specifically on the Twitter context. This paper uses corpus-informed critical discourse studies to explore how cognitive models of lesbianism are articulated in transgender Twitter discourse/s. Findings indicate that transgender Twitter users (re)articulate sociohistorical narratives in lesbian discourse/s. At the same time, however, they also challenge and (re)politicize the essentialism of sex and gender in relation to lesbian identity and social practice. Hence, transgender Twitter discourse/s reflect potential explanations for contesting transinclusion in lesbianism, which may serve to reinforce transexclusionary claims for retaining lesbianism's uniqueness as a female space and experience.

Results were organized into a conceptual map, with a central category (power), connected to three other ecological categories (culture, community systems, and relationships) and one category of survivor experiences. Each category has subcategories which illustrate certain contextual and internal barriers to reporting assault. The model shows how these barriers intersect and interact, and often further traumatize those who have been assaulted. The model offers implications for professionals working with those who have survived sexual trauma, as well as those studying the dynamics of abuse.

Such studies were previously limited by the cost and feasibility of large‐scale surveys; however, language‐based computational models applied to large social media datasets now allow for large‐scale personality assessment. Method: We applied a language‐based assessment of the five factor model of personality to 6,064,267 U.S. Twitter users. We aggregated the Twitter‐based personality scores to 2,041 counties and compared to political, economic, social, and health outcomes measured through surveys and by government agencies. Results: There was significant personality variation across counties. Openness to experience was higher on the coasts, conscientiousness was uniformly spread, extraversion was higher in southern states, agreeableness was higher in western states, and emotional stability was highest in the south. Across 13 outcomes, language‐based personality estimates replicated patterns that have been observed in individual‐level and geographic studies. This includes higher Republican vote share in less agreeable counties and increased life satisfaction in more conscientious counties. Conclusions: Results suggest that regions vary in their personality and that these differences can be studied through computational linguistic analysis of social media. Furthermore, these methods may be used to explore other psychological constructs across geographies.

Method: We collected an intensive set of 24 (52 subscales) personality traits and attributes (N = 239) and examined whether machine learning models trained on four different types of SNS (i.e., Twitter) information (network, time, word statistics, and bag of words) predict the traits and attributes. Results: We found that four types of SNS information can predict 23 subscales collectively. Furthermore, we validated our hypothesis that the network and word statistics information, respectively, exhibit unique strengths for the prediction of inter‐personal traits such as autism and mental health traits such as schizophrenia and anxiety. We also found that intelligence is predicted by all four types of SNS information. Conclusions: These results reveal that the different types of SNS information can collectivity predict wider human traits and attributes than previously recognized, and also that each information type has unique predictive strengths for specific traits and attributes, suggesting that personality prediction from SNS is a powerful tool for both personality psychology and information technology.

Contrary to cultural affective values, however, U.S. users were more influenced by changes in others' high arousal negative (e.g., angry) posts, whereas Japanese were more influenced by changes in others' high arousal positive (e.g., excited) posts. These patterns held after controlling for differences in baseline exposure to affective content, and across different topics. Together, these results suggest that across cultures, while social media users primarily produce content that supports their affective values, they are more influenced by content that violates those values. These findings have implications for theories about which affective content spreads on social media, and for applications related to the optimal design and use of social media platforms around the world.

Much progress has been made, but—as in other areas of research—this work has been criticized for relying on small and statistically unrepresentative samples and the use of reactive, self-report measures that lack ecological validity. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we employed automated text analytic methods to investigate the spontaneous, naturally occurring use of language in nearly 25,000 Twitter users. We derived 27 hypotheses from the literature on political psychology and tested them using 32 individual dictionaries. In 23 cases, we observed significant differences in the linguistic styles of liberals and conservatives. For instance, liberals used more language that conveyed benevolence, whereas conservatives used more language pertaining to threat, power, tradition, resistance to change, certainty, security, anger, anxiety, and negative emotion in general. In 17 cases, there were also significant effects of ideological extremity. For instance, moderates used more benevolent language, whereas extremists used more language pertaining to inhibition, tentativeness, affiliation, resistance to change, certainty, security, anger, anxiety, negative affect, swear words, and death-related language. These research methods, which are easily adaptable, open up new and unprecedented opportunities for conducting unobtrusive research in psycholinguistics and political psychology with large and diverse samples.

Study 1 found that people residing in more racially diverse metropolitan areas were more likely to tweet prosocial concepts in their everyday lives. Study 2 found that following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, people in more racially diverse neighborhoods were more likely to spontaneously offer help to individuals stranded by the bombings. Study 3 found that people living in more ethnically diverse countries were more likely to report having helped a stranger in the past month. Providing evidence of the underlying mechanism. Study 4 found that people living in more racially diverse neighborhoods were more likely to identify with all of humanity, which explained their greater likelihood of having helped a stranger in the past month. Finally, providing causal evidence for the relationship between neighborhood diversity and prosociality, Study 5 found that people asked to imagine that they were living in a more racially diverse neighborhood were more willing to help others in need, and this effect was mediated by a broader identity. The studies identify a novel mechanism through which exposure to diversity can influence people, and document a novel consequence of this mechanism.

During the summer of 2019, Iran’s relations with Western democracies were further strained by Iranian attacks on foreign commercial ships in the Gulf of Oman and on a US surveillance drone. Shortly thereafter, President Trump announced on Twitter that he had ordered an air strike against Iranian targets, only to rescind the order minutes before contact. We explore Iran’s response to Trump and the international crisis that emerged during the spring and summer of 2019. Our article utilizes a content analysis to descriptively account for the politics and political messages that Zarif and Khamenei sought to promote. We also pay particular attention to the content criticizing America and its leadership during this time as we seek to understand Iran’s interest in provoking the United States on social media.

We study how parties attract voters under the redistributive pressure created by COVID-19, looking into the 2021 Ecuadorian elections. We classify the messages that candidates sent, evaluate if and how candidates used COVID-19 to mobilize voters, and assess how voters reacted to them. We followed 858 virtual events and gathered more than 1'575.000 tweets from candidates and their communities. We find that candidates did not place COVID-19 at the center of their strategies but used it to connect with symbolic messages about the capabilities of parties and candidates. Twitter users had a limited engagement with COVID-19-related content. These findings nuance our expectations of the pandemic. COVID-19 was only an element rather than the core of electoral strategies. Our empirical approach can be easily extended to other cases where in-person events are still limited.
