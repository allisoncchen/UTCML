This paper offers a theoretical and empirical exploration of a less-frequently discussed form of solidarity between two diverse campaigns; one based less on shared identity and more on shared values; one that is aimed less at persistence and more at short-term impact. Building upon earlier conceptual work (Wright et al. 2018), we call this form drive-by solidarity because of its one-way, unsolicited, hit-and-run nature. This paper examines drive-by solidarity through case of Anonymous' ""Operation KKK"" (#OpKKK), an online hacktivist campaign against the Ku Klux Klan carried out in response to threats of violence they made against #BlackLivesMatter protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in November 2014. After constructing a timeline of events from available news stories and videos for context, we use over three million tweets to conduct a series of network analyses to model the most significant online accounts associated with each campaign as well as the connections built across the respective online discursive spheres through retweets and mentions. We graph both the period of the 2014 #OpKKK campaign, along with its revival one year later, in order to empirically examine the short- and long-term effects. Although Anonymous acted unilaterally and made no efforts to be inclusive of #BlackLivesMatter activists in their deliberations, the campaigns became politically coordinated. #OpKKK successfully achieved its initial goals; however, longer-term effects were more volatile. This form of solidarity is theoretically compelling because it seems to challenge much extant theory on the role of identity in building solidarities, and even forces us to rethink social movement success. Furthermore, we propose that drive-by solidarity could offer a possible model for other movements seeking high-impact, low cost, short-term campaigns.

Such is the power of images of the child they can and have shaped the history of nation states, shifted policy and become emblematic of a cry for change. In journalism, filmmaking, and news media the child can become the symbol of a nation, a conflict, a tragedy and the failure of policy, or indeed the adult world, to care and protect childhood itself. Using evocative images from across the 20th and 21st century, this paper interrogates how idealised notions of childhood become focal and challenged by images which reveal the death, deprivation and destruction of children. The image of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi's body on a Turkish Beach in 2015 resonated around the world. It became the biggest trending photo on Twitter within 24 h and graced the front of hundreds of global newspapers the following day. It also demanded a political response, as presidents and prime ministers scrambled to hold press conferences and generate policy to respond to the Syrian and wider so-called Mediterranean crisis. This is just a recent example in a long line of iconic images of 'the child' that have shaped policy and shifted hearts and minds. The power and influence of these photographs is traced here to highlight where the discursive vulnerability of a single child becomes emblematic of the failures of the powerful: adults, governments, nation states, and global governance. Using the examples of famine stricken South Sudan (1993) and the 'migrant crisis' of the Mediterranean Sea (2015), how these hitherto anonymous children briefly become everybody's child is explored here.",media; images; photographs; childhood; social construction,WOS,N/A,,,,,,,,0

Literary research and the descriptive analysis of 1,712 tweets and retweets published by @IntlCrimCourt between November 2017 and June 2019 reveal that the ICC primarily used Twitter to provide information and build support among its most powerful stakeholders.

To do so, we conduct a rigorous qualitative analysis of discourse during a two-week period in which the Florida legislature considered and passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act after a shooter killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. We systematically explore how two framing dynamics ‚Äì competition and amplification ‚Äì shape what frames political actors champion and the relative effects of these dynamics on individual claimsmaking in 438 letters to the editor and op-eds appearing in mainstream outlets, 4,962 emails sent to Florida Governor Rick Scott, and 1,000 tweets. We find that amplification and competition shape the relative visibility of frames and the frequency with which individuals use these frames in their claimsmaking. Generally speaking, gun control and progressive groups selectively amplified frames associated with the emerging, student-led Never Again Marjory Stoneman Douglas movement and legislative frames that were consistent with their goals. This seems to have increased the visibility of these ideas in mainstream outlets and influenced claimsmaking insofar as individuals drew on amplified frames across the forums relatively frequently. This was not true of frames opposing gun control. Gun rights groups bickered with politicians and among themselves. As a result, gun rights frames were less prevalent in mainstream discourse and in individual claimsmaking.

This study thereby examined how national health departments deployed persuasive strategies to promote citizen engagement in COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets in six countries, including the UK, the US, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and India. Guided by the heuristic-systematic model and the health belief model, we found that national health departments differed significantly in the use of systematic-heuristic cues and health belief constructs in COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets. Generally, the provision of scientific information and appeals to anecdotes and fear positively, while appeals to bandwagon negatively, predicted citizen engagement. Messages about overcoming barriers and promoting vaccine benefits and self-efficacy positively affected engagement. Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate demonstrated negative impacts. Importantly, health departments across countries often used futile or detrimental strategies in tweets. A locally adapted evidence-based approach for COVID-19 vaccination persuasion was discussed. ‚Ä¢ Health departments often used detrimental tactics in promoting COVID-19 vaccines. ‚Ä¢ Appeals to facts, anecdotes, and fear promoted citizen engagement. ‚Ä¢ Appeals to bandwagon reduced citizen engagement. ‚Ä¢ Messages about efficacies and benefits promoted citizen engagement. ‚Ä¢ Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate harmed citizen engagement.

Ubiquitous visual technologies, the possibility to distribute and use images from heterogeneous sources across different social contexts and publics, and increasingly powerful facial recognition tools afford new avenues for law enforcement. Concurrently, these changes also trigger fundamental concerns about privacy violations and all-encompassing surveillance. Using the example of police investigations after the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, the present article provides insights into how different actors in the political and public realm in Germany deal with these potentials and tensions in handling visual data. Based on a qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles (n=42), tweets (n=267), experts‚Äô reports (n=3), and minutes of parliamentary debates and committee hearings (n=8), this study examines how visual data were collected, analyzed, and published and how different actors legitimated and contested these practices. The findings show that combined state, corporate, and privately produced visual data and the use of facial recognition tools allowed the police to cover and track public life in large parts of the inner city of Hamburg during the summit days. Police authorities characterized visual data and algorithmic tools as objective, trustworthy, and indispensable evidence-providing tools but black-boxed the heterogeneity of sources, the analytical steps, and their potential implications. Critics, in turn, expressed concerns about infringements of civic rights, the trustworthiness of police authorities, and the extensive police surveillance capacities. Based on these findings, this article discusses three topics that remained blind spots in the debates but merit further attention in discussions on norms for visual data management and for governing visibility: (1) collective responsibilities in visibility management, (2) trust in visual data and facial recognition technologies, and (3) social consequences of encompassing visual data collection and registered faceprints.

I also performed a feminist discourse analysis on both the tweets and news coverage of the campaign to situate the hashtag within its historical, social, and political context.

Cho‚Äôs choice to centre herself in the campaign made it impossible to separate Cho from the hashtag, preventing #12DaysofRage from greater viral potential, but still acting as a resonant, but ephemeral, gathering point for survivor-focused advocacy.",,SAGE,N/A,,,,,,,,0

Turei confessed she lied to authorities in the 1990s, prompting a flood of supportive posts. Soon after, right-wing oppositional tweets were posted (n = 288) contesting the arguments of Turei and her supporters, and left-wing responses to those arguments (n = 214). Drawing on Mouffe's dissensual model, this article undertakes a close, qualitative analysis of those 502 tweets, in order to move towards a method for empirically distinguishing between antagonistic and agonistic tweets, identifying the latter as putting forward arguments which can be identified by the researcher and potentially engaged with by ideologically opposed adversaries. The results show a majority of the tweets were agonistic, with implications for the future study of social media policy debates and for the online practices of scholars.

It is also part of research on the use of Twitter by religious people and the use of social media in the Arab world, and more specifically the current article focuses on the priorities of Arab religious preachers in the Arab-Muslim world in their uses of Twitter. I have chosen a Muslim preacher who has been the owner of the most followed Twitter account in the Arab-Muslim world: Mohamad al-Arefe. At the time of my research, this Saudi Sunni preacher was ranked in the 83rd1 place in the global ranking of the most followed Twitter accounts in the world. This article aims to develop a typology of content shared on Twitter by al-Arefe. This research examines the way the Twitter platform is being used by this preacher, and it answers the question whether the theoretical model of religion mediatisation applies to the content shared by al-Arefe. This article combines two methodological approaches to study the content shared by al-Arefe on his Twitter account: a quantitative method and a qualitative one. I focus on the analysis of three elements present among the contents shared by this preacher on his Twitter account: Hashtags, visuals and links. Finally, my analysis shows how al-Arefe focuses more on his person and his image than he focuses on presenting Islamic teachings.

Das leadership beider Bewegungen ist mit jeweils einem Dutzend Personen relativ klein. Zur Erforschung des leadership von sozialen Bewegungen bieten sich insbesondere Methoden der Biographieforschung an. In ethnologischen Forschungsarbeiten wird die Biographieforschung meist mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden wie der Teilnehmenden Beobachtung kombiniert. Zentral f√ºr die Ethnologie sind weiterhin ein Perspektivwechsel und die lange Feldforschung. Dabei erheben Ethnolog*innen sehr unterschiedliche biographische Daten und verkn√ºpfen diese miteinander. F√ºr den vorliegenden Artikel erhoben Jan Budniok und Andrea mit den Biographien der Mitglieder des leadership auch ihre Familiengeschichten, um mehr √ºber Darstellung historisch gewachsener Netzwerke zu erfahren. Zudem h√§ngen die individuellen Beweggr√ºnde aktiv zu werden in den hier untersuchten F√§llen oft mit der eigenen Familiengeschichte zusammen oder werden in einem solchen Zusammenhang dargestellt, um das eigene Handeln zu legitimieren. Diese Kombination von Biographieforschung mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden ist eine St√§rke des ethnographischen Ansatzes und kann auch von anderen Disziplinen in der Erforschung sozialer Bewegungen fruchtbar gemacht werden. In 2014, due to an economic crisis, several new protest groups evolved in Ghana. The most prominent amongst them were Occupy Ghana and the Citizen Ghana Movement. Comprising of just a dozen people, the leadership groups of both these movements were relatively small. One of the best methods of researching the leadership of social movements is biographical research. Anthropologists usually combine biographical research with other ethnographic methods, most prominently participant observation. Crucial in anthropological research is a change in the research perspective as well as the long duration of field research. Anthropologists thus collect very different types of biographical data that they then connect to each other. Thus, for the article Jan Budniok and Andrea Noll collect not only the biographies of the interview partners themselves but also their family histories in order to learn more about how historically developed networks are represented. What is more, the reasons for becoming active in a leadership role are often linked to the individual's family history. Or rather, activists make use of their family histories to legitimize their activism. This combination of biographical research with other ethnographic methods is one of the strengths of the ethnographic approach, and one which other disciplines researching social movements may well take advantage of.
