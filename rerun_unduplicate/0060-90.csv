As the term was being debated on many a media outlet, sociologists explained that beurette is embedded in a colonial rhetoric that fetishizes Oriental women and noted that its contemporary usage is mostly associated with the pornographic industry, suggesting a discriminatory if niche representation of Arab women in France. Through an analysis of the travel writing of Gilles Kepel, France's leading expert on Islamism, this article argues that this representation is not restricted to the marginal production of adult content but that it is instead found in a public representation of Islam that, behind its denunciation of Islamism, hides a French yearning for the colonial mission civilisatrice.

The Case of the European COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter,FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY,10.3389/fsoc.2022.884640,,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a critical phase for the transnationalization of public spheres. Against this backdrop, we ask how transnational COVID-19 related online discourse has been throughout the EU over the first year of the pandemic. Which events triggered higher transnational coherence or national structuration of this specific issue public on Twitter? In order to study these questions, we rely on Twitter data obtained from the TBCOV database, i.e., a dataset for multilingual, geolocated COVID-19 related Twitter communication. We selected corpora for the 27 member states of the EU plus the United Kingdom. We defined three research periods representing different phases of the pandemic, namely April (1st wave), August (interim) and December 2020 (2nd wave) resulting in a set of 51,893,966 unique tweets for comparative analysis. In order to measure the level and temporal variation of transnational discursive linkages, we conducted a spatiotemporal network analysis of so-called Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). HINs allow for the integration of multiple, heterogeneous network entities (hashtags, retweets, @-mentions, URLs and named entities) to better represent the complex discursive structures reflected in social media communication. Therefrom, we obtained an aggregate measure of transnational linkages on a daily base by relating these linkages back to their geolocated authors. We find that the share of transnational discursive linkages increased over the course of the pandemic, indicating effects of adaptation and learning. However, stringent political measures of crisis management at the domestic level (such as lockdown decisions) caused stronger national structuration of COVID-19 related Twitter discourse.",MEDIA; Twitter; COVID-19; PATTERNS; discourse analysis; POWER; SITES; DISEASE; dynamic networks; European public sphere; heterogeneous information networks; transnationalization,WOS,1,,,,,,,,0

Social media platforms and online environments, which provide additional channels to reach the reader, both open new areas for news producers and reveal different usage patterns from traditional media for consumers. The study investigates the trends in news production, distribution, and consumption in different social media platforms as an alternative field. In the study, Twitter, Instagram, and Telegram platforms were discussed, and content production, distribution, and consumption styles were examined in the context of journalism, based on the assumption that Telegram is an alternative channel for creating public opinion, increasing interaction and creating their brands for journalists. In this context, Twitter, which functions more as a news sharing application, Instagram, which has increased in popularity in recent years, and Telegram, which stands out with its bot and channel creation features, are evaluated. The shares on the Cia Medya Telegram channel, Cia Haber Instagram page and Cia Haber Twitter page, which constitute the sample of the research, were analyzed by content analysis method, and it was concluded that the Telegram platform is used more actively in content production, distribution and interaction.

Specifically, we are interested in analysing the ways in which processes such as polarization or incivility are manifested on social networks. Our thesis is that, in addition to the central role played by structural machismo, there are particular characteristics of online debate that regulate the presence of polarization and incivility. In order to assess this, we analyse two case studies on Twitter, 'La Manada' and 'Cu√©ntalo'. We demonstrate how spontaneous digital debates favour the emergence of negative behaviours, while those that, as is the case with 'Cu√©ntalo', are organized and structured, favour more respectful, less polarized communication.

The most important infrastructural element of this information society is the internet which enables dissemination of information in a very efficient and effective way, independent from the physical proximity between two networked computers. The internet is nonhierarchical (horizontal) in the sense that it does not have an ultimate power center which determines the structure of the networks and the contents that flow within and between networks. The formation of the networks and the content of information disseminated through them are shaped by the users. Hence, the interplay between internet and individuals is bidirectional; individuals structure the networks and the structure of networks, in turn, shapes the perception of individuals regarding self, community, and time. This paper analyzes how and why people use Twitter‚Äîboth a social networking site and a micro-blogger; to what extent Twitter use reflect the constituting principles of contemporary society such as conception of time and how it may affect our notion of community and social relations. It argues that Twitter represents a replica of hypermodern society with the apprehension of time streaming embedded in its use, clustering of users around personal and professional communities and centers and the strategies that users develop in order to deal with the complexity of online hypermodernity. Twitter, and social network sites in general, are structured by the values and conceptions of the contemporary society and we need to consider them within a greater zeitgeist. The main function of these services is to reinforce and enhance the conceptions and experience of hypermodernity and to increase the rate of social change further.

We used content analysis to generate descriptive frequencies, before analysing these broad patterns in further detail via qualitative analysis. Nationhood is found to be largely absent, at least explicitly. A large majority focus on the contingencies of everyday life in highly individualist and consumer-oriented ways. The most common identification ‚Äì ""non-EU"" ‚Äì indicates border-crossing experiences framed by geopolitical inequalities, but only rarely by nationhood. One possible exception to the dominant patterns is a highly individualist, tacit manifestation of Britishness.

Our paper reflects on the increased use of social media and empowerment among low-income students (Micheli 2016) and the increasing technological disadvantage that is created when using social media among lowincome and non-traditional students (Greenhow, Walker, and Kim 2009). We examine areas of discomfort among low-income, non-traditional, and minority students, including the lack of technology and internet connectivity in the students' households before college, abuse in social media, creating community and networks, and proper and improper usage of social media. We also argue that teaching of social media use that does not address these areas of discomfort may exacerbate cumulative disadvantages (Diprete and Eirich 2006). We examine how one's background plays a role in creating comfort and discomfort using social media. We provide strategies based on years of experience and past surveys of empowering all students in the classroom by using social media related to our primary teaching areas: race, health, culture, and methods.

This study finds that Twitter users upload their tweets to share important messages for the winter storm, such as weather changes and road conditions. Next, some people think that governments use the winter storm to move people's attention from the serious problems in their life to the weather issue. Third, people are highly interested in a temporary school or workplace closing and weather forecast channels in the winter storm week. Fourth, tweets have the most frequent keywords, such as day, ice, and today, which are related to the weather during the winter storm. Lastly, the spatial pattern of the proportion of tweets is differentiated by regions and periods.

This study suggests that the proportion of tweets is highly concentrated in the north‚Äêeast region, which is the most damaged region in the winter storm week. Second, there is significant spatial autocorrelation for the number of tweets related to the winter storm. The lag coefficient values of the spatial lag model and the spatial error model are 0.362 and 0.437 at a 0.01 significance level, respectively. Third, younger people and people who have less than a high school degree show a positive coefficient value, whereas males, people with a high school degree, and those who have high income show a negative coefficient value for the number of tweets. This study shows that spatial regression models would be better models to understand human responses to natural disasters than the ordinary least squares model.

This includes research to describe and specify the control condition, typically 'current care', for effectiveness trials. This paper aims to identify physical therapy outcomes commonly targeted, and intervention techniques and approaches commonly used, by physiotherapists working with children (aged 2‚Äì19 years) with mobility limitations in the United Kingdom. Methods: A cross‚Äêsectional survey. Participants were recruited through the interactive Chartered Society of Physiotherapy members‚Äêonly online discussion forum, the Association of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists, direct emails and snowball sampling within the authors' professional networks and Twitter. Data were collected using a structured online questionnaire and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: We received 146 responses, 95/146 (65.1%) of which were fully complete. Therapists reported targeting 367 unique outcome constructs, of which 193 (52.6%) mapped onto activities and participation (e.g. moving around using equipment, maintaining body position and walking), 158 (43.1%) on body functions (e.g. muscle strength, joint mobility and gait functions), 11 (3.0%) on body structure (e.g. muscle length) and 3 (0.8%) on environmental factors (e.g. access home environment, access school environment and family confidence). The most commonly used interventions related to postural management (115/133 of respondents, 86.4%) and exercise therapy (116/137, 84.67%) and included techniques such as 'use equipment' (118/137, 86.1%), 'instruct how to do something' (117/137, 85.4%), 'practice' (105/137, 76.6%) and 'stretch' (99/137, 72.3%). Conclusions: In designing trials, current care can be described as a combination of biomechanical and physiological techniques and approaches targeted at body functions and through that to activity and participation. Although some environmental behaviour change techniques and strategies were reported, the explicit use of these in current care appears limited.

Antifascism's interest in the built environment is often limited to the collection of address data of right-wing extremists with the aim of locating its enemies. In this piece, I write with fascism and violence through vignettes of urban situatedness. I adopt an eclectic approach, engaging with diverse theories of violence and establishing loose connections between classical sociology and fascist urbanisation, liberalism in practice and historical fascism, and material aesthetics and right-wing spaces. In so doing, I highlight endemic forms of state and capitalist violence and their spatial manifestations of ghettoisation, beautification and overcoding. Acknowledging the limits of factual knowledge and liberal appeals to the truth in breaking through fascist worldviews of domination, the architecture of the text uses a circular infrastructure that connects various parties: 'they' (Twitter users), 'I' (author), 'you' (Walter Benjamin), and numerous 'we' who are thrown together in urban environments. Rather than developing a linear argument that tries to persuade fascists, I explore writing as a collective political practice that refutes totalising accounts. With the aim of opening meaning-makings through returning to and reworking numerous views, I respond to a spiral of violence with a movement that is organised around a shared commitment to an anti-oppressive, non-hierarchical world; a movement that is out of someone's control and that spirals towards collective liberation.

Samples include 78 - 3rd year students, English language program, faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Bangkok, Thailand. A Likert Scale Questionnaire is used to collect the data, and the statistics employed include percentage, mean, and Standard Deviation. The research findings point out that the most frequently used social media tool is Line followed by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter respecttively. Moreover, students' engagements with English outside the classroom accomplish a range of communicative functions in English in high level taking about 6-8 hours per day. 7 functions found in high level with the highest mean score of such engagements include 1) watching cartoon with English sound track from websites followed by 2) reading articles in English form journals and magazines, 3) watching TV programs in English from TV, 4) using online dictionaries to solve linguistic problems, 5) reading comments in English from blogs and forum based, 6) watching entertainment and documentaries in English from online medias, and 7) reading news in English from printed newspapers respectively. It is noticeable that 4 out of the 7 functions found in high level are ca-rried out by social media tools. However, 2 functions found in low level taking less than 2 hours/day inc-lude 1) listening to music in English from CD or radio and 2) using printed English-English dictionary to solve linguistic problems.
