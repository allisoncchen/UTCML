With the rise in social media, scholars have become increasingly interested in how the nature of content on social media might be related to its dissemination across online social networks. In this paper, we examine how content differentiation affects the spread of a social movement. We argue that the various stages of a protest cycle moderate the relationship between the innovativeness of content related to a movement and the rate of diffusion of the movement. To test our propositions, we adopt methods from natural language processing to conduct a computational analysis of content related to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter from May 2016 to July 2016. Our findings show that tweets with less differentiated content are more likely to spread during the initial stage of a protest cycle - which we call the ripening stage - but when the movement gains momentum - entering what we call the frenzy stage - tweets with more differentiated content are more likely to spread.

Thus, the aim of this research is to study how listed companies in Spain have used one of the most popular social channels, such as Twitter, to transfer their intangible assets to their stakeholders. To this end, the communication of IBEX35 companies in Spain with a verified corporate profile on Twitter has been studied during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the main results, it should be noted that the transfer of intangible assets has been based on a strategy where providing added value was the connecting axis of the communication actions implemented and the content provided on Twitter. Hence, this work demonstrates that companies can provide added value in social networks to generate trust, build long-term relationships and strengthen their competitive advantage.

We find that a characteristic pattern emerges at the global scale: a decrease in misinformation on Twitter as the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases increases.

This article studies the importance of geographical origin in the digital age for the case of popular music production. More concretely, we study the extent to which the internet helps reducing inequality between artists from central cities in popular music production (e.g. New York, London) versus more peripheral cities. Our focus is on differences in media attention both by professional music critics and consumers, and how this is related to (a) the cities in which artists are located, and (b) the social media resources artists have at their disposal. Our analysis concerns one month of new pop album releases. The results show that artists coming from more central cities have higher chances to get media attention -- both by professional and amateur critics -- than artists from peripheral cities. Building a fan base on social media such as Facebook, Twitter or MySpace can compensate some of this inequality, but not all.

Individual Twitter users can be represented as nodes and retweeted by another Twitter user, thereby forming a relationship, an edge, between users. However, an unbounded network is a sprawling mass of nodes and edges. Boundary settings are typically applied, for example, a time period, a hashtag, a keyword search or a network substructure of a phenomenon of interest. Thus, the particular visualisation created is dependent upon the boundaries applied, enabling productive visual consumption, but concealing its social shaping. To explore this question of boundary setting and its associated issues, we draw on an example from the Twitter discussions about the UK Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, and the media debate surrounding the contractual hours of junior doctors during 2015‚Äì2016. We discuss the role and impact differing stakeholders have in setting these boundaries. We seek to provide a set of 'questioning lenses' in which we ask why these boundary settings were selected, what effect they have, and what are the potential implications of these boundary setting techniques on the visualisation consumer.

The crisis of truth refers to an era where evidence and objective facts get lost in sentiment, emotion, and personal beliefs. Relying on emotions, creationism, religious beliefs, and common sense over expertise deliberately creates counter-knowledge referred to as pseudo-science, troll-science or fake-science. As the worth of scientific expertise is devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through populist political rhetoric help to produce a culture of resistance to science. Our qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts along with the news regarding anti-vaccine arguments from two selected online news sites, revealed three major themes, which we referred to as strategies used by the COVID-19 vaccine deniers in Turkey to disseminate their views. These were: an emphasis on bodily freedom and personal choice and the use of ""my body my choice"" rhetoric; the denying, devaluing, and shifting of scientific evidence; and the dismissal and/or attacking of alternative views and the deepening of the polarisation between the supporters of the COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine supporters and deniers. We conclude the paper by arguing that there is a link between the distrust of doctors and the anti-vaccination ideas, and the quest for alternative knowledge and expert authority.

Although the nonstandard form has been labeled in the literature as a calque of Spanish tener que + infinitive 'to have to', it appears in Twitter messages in all of the dialects analyzed. In fact, in our sample there are dialects in which tenir que occurs more frequently than haver de. Grammatical person of the verb used (haver or tenir) is also analyzed as a factor behind the choice of modal periphrasis. Multivariate analysis has been employed, determining that both of these factors (dialect and grammatical person) are statistically significant. The results of the multivariate analysis allow us to apply van Coetsem's (1988) theoretical framework in an attempt to describe the language contact situation in the different dialects. Source-language (sl) agentivity appears to be at work in the dialects where the nonstandard variant is prevalent, while recipient-language (rl) agentivity could be behind the use of the standard variant in the other dialects.

For many people, SM is reshaping their social world, rewriting the rules of social engagement and sociability. The use of SM has grown drastically in the past decade. Referring to the data released by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), more than half of the population are internet users and more than 90 percent of the internet users visit social networking platforms as their online activities. Referring to the same data, most of the internet users are between the age of 20s to 40s. Despite the drastic changes in SM uses, many ethical and social issues arise. The critical issues that occur in the existence of SM among others are the spread of fake news, online harassment, privacy issues, and cyberbullies. Therefore, this research aims to gain some insights into the ethical and social issues in SM among university students in Malaysia. Ethnography will be the qualitative approach for the study whereby this approach is the best approach to study people in their own environment through the use of methods such as participant observation and face-to-face interviewing. The research will apply purposive sampling as an approach to seek subjects who have some specific knowledge or expertise relevant to the topic. In other words, they are rich in the information needed for this study. Online interviews will be conducted as a method for data collection from twenty-eight (28) students from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The data will be analysed using thematic analysis whereby Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel (since most higher education institutions (HEIs) have Microsoft licenses for both faculty and students to use the Microsoft Office 365 suite) will be used as a tool to code and organise the key point and themes. The thematic analysis is a data analysis process in which themes and relationships are established by identifying statements or phrases of the data. This research involved six phases, from; i) familiarization the data set from both respondents and moderators, and ii) generating systematic codes, by identifying the relevant data within the data set, and iii) tagging the data with specific phrases or words. Next, iv) process the pattern formation, and v) identification of the first version of theme development. Theme development involves examining codes and combining, clustering, or collapsing the codes together into bigger or more meaningful patterns. Finally, vi) generate and review the top five key points per theme in addition to the key points related to the research. The approach integrates a widely used application software suite for organizing, coding, and classifying data. The features that Microsoft Excel offers as a tool to organize the key points or themes, crucially do not require advanced knowledge of the software. This research will emphasize the importance of the data analysis step in increasing the validity and reliability of findings and outline a method of analysis that is accessible to the researchers.

Before the digital revolution, the relationship between the politician and the voter was intermediated by journalists and broadcast media. In contrast to traditional media, social media are presumed to enable politicians to engage directly with the electorate (Kruikemeier, Van Noort, Vliegenthart & De Vreese, 2015). In the last decade, there was a growing interest in the role of social media in election campaigns, triggered by Barack Obama's electoral presidential election victory in 2008 and more recently by Donald Trumps' triumph in 2016 (Rodriguez-Andres, 2018). The research presented in this article answers three main questions. First, who are the politicians using Twitter for campaigning purposes and what variables can predict Twitter use? Second, when do Belgian politicians use it and with which frequency? And third: do tweeting politicians perform better at the ballot box? The main findings reveal that a Flemish candidate has a higher probability of 18,7% to be present on Twitter compared to a candidate from the French community. Another important finding is that there is no significant association between the number of tweets and number of preferential votes, although a trend towards significance was observed for Flemish politicians.

Uganda has levied the world's first tax on social media users, imposing in 2018 a daily tax on the use of fiftyeight websites and applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Skype. To access these platforms, one must pay a daily fee of 200 Ugandan Shillings ($.054 USD). This Note will use the Ugandan social media tax as a case study through which to examine the legality, under international law, of financial burdens designed to suppress political dissent. While the analysis will focus solely on Uganda's law, much of it will apply beyond Uganda's borders to countries pursuing similar legislation. Part I provides important background with respect to the Ugandan scheme. Part II explores freedom of expression over the Internet under international law and determines what types of restrictions on expression are legally permissible. Part III analyzes whether a tax that affects speech would be considered a restriction of expression. Finally, Part IV examines the social media tax through the lens of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and analyzes the consequences of a determination that the social media tax violates international norms, both within Uganda and more broadly across East Africa.

These results have real-world and theoretical ramifications for policymakers and entrepreneurial education, such as using widely used yet cutting-edge communication and Internet tools to inspire young people to start their own businesses. In this analysis, we test the hypothesis that there is a connection between the time spent on social networking sites (SNS) and measures of confidence in, and desire for, starting one's own business. Over two hundred and fifty female students from Private Universities in Bangladesh participated in online questionnaires and correlation tests. More time spent on social networking sites is correlated with more serious business thinking and behavior. Students of all sexes and all ages use Facebook, but younger students and women in particular associate the platform with entrepreneurial aspirations and attitudes more strongly than their male counterparts. There is a greater understanding of the relationship between social media presence and entrepreneurship factors because to this research. The researchers sorted the interviewees' responses into four groups based on their findings: how often they used SNS, how much they felt supported by SNS, how secure they felt in their entrepreneurial conduct, and how ambitious they wanted to be as business owners' Important motifs were also determined for each class. Institutions of higher learning may and should use social media to promote and educate aspiring business owners.

We collected three months of social media data to investigate variation in the temporal structure of sociability across American cities. We find that cities cluster into three distinct types ('Coastal', 'Transitional' and 'Heartland') and that geographic proximity together with race, education and language associate with this clustering. Specifically, we found that clusters of Blacker cities tend to tweet more per capita, but also that more highly educated cities tend to tweet less per capita. These findings provide evidence that social media may be facilitating new opportunities to empower traditionally marginalized urban groups, a conclusion relevant to #BlackLivesMatter, the George Floyd protests and other social movements.

110,293,1609,journalArticle,2022.0,"Isomaa, R",YouTube Drama in an Atheist Public: A Case Study,SECULARISM & NONRELIGION,10.5334/snr.146,,"In late March 2019, British atheist YouTuber ""Rationality Rules"" published a video in which he argued that trans women should be excluded from women's sports. Accused of transphobia, he was denounced by a prominent atheist organization, which led to intense arguments in Anglophone atheist spaces on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, lasting throughout the year. This article uses the controversy, an instance ""YouTube drama,"" as an opportunity to investigate the ways in which an imagined ""atheist community"" is constructed through internal atheist conflict. Through critical discourse analysis of 157 YouTube videos, published between the end of March and the end of November, it identifies six different discursive formations, which affected the development of the drama and offer competing conceptions of the community. By utilizing Michael Warner's theory of 'publics' and tounterpublics,' spaces that exists only for the circulation of discourse, this study approaches the drama not as an interpersonal conflict, but as a battle over the norms of discourse within the atheist community. It suggests that a public lens is useful for understanding contemporary atheism, and that the nature of publics and counterpublics helps explain the dynamics of atheist disagreement on social issues.",YouTube; drama; RELIGION; atheism; publics; transphobia,WOS,N/A,,,,,,,,0

The investigation uses critical discourse and documentary analysis and a framework derived from the theory of Pierre Bourdieu to analyze textual and audiovisual postings on UPF Facebook pages, YouTube channels, and Twitter accounts. Relevant to the discussion are Bourdieu's interdependent theories on ""doxa"" as a condition in which socially constructed phenomena appear self-evident, and ""habitus"" and ""field,"" which explain how structures and agents, through their reflexive behavior, become dialectically situated.

In fact, the key online actors in the Arab World in 2011 had been online activists for many years and were part of activist networks facilitated organizations such as the blogger community Global Voices, who brought like-minded activists from across the region together, for example via their yearly conference (p.15).

In this article, we turn our attention to the production of addiction on the microblogging social media platform, Twitter, as an important emerging site in which the addicting of contemporary societies is also occurring. Our analysis explores two questions. First, we investigate the ways in which addiction is enacted via Twitter. How is addiction being made on Twitter? Second, we ask how the technology of Twitter itself is shaping meaning: how do the technological ‚Äúaffordances‚Äù of Twitter help constitute the kinds of addiction being materialized? While we find a multiplicity of meanings in the 140-character messages, we also find a pattern: a tendency toward extremes‚Äîaddiction riven between pain and pleasure. In addition, we find significant areas of commonality between approaches and notable silences around alternatives to common understandings of addiction. We argue that the constraints on communication imposed by Twitter technology afford a ‚Äúshorthand‚Äù of addiction that is both revealing and productive. Illuminated is the importance of addiction as a piece of cultural shorthand that draws on and simultaneously reproduces simplistic, reductive addiction objects. In concluding, we consider what these realities of addiction being enacted through Twitter can tell us about contemporary conditions of possibility for drug use in society and for individual subjectivities and experiences.

These debates on social media represent a larger struggle over discourse on race and racism across the nation. Drawing from critical theory and race theory, and engaging in the relatively new practice of using Twitter as a source of data for sociological analysis, this article examines Twitter as an emerging public sphere and studies the hashtags ‚Äú#AllLivesMatter‚Äù and ‚Äú#BlackLivesMatter‚Äù as contested signs that represent dominant ideologies. This article consists of a qualitative textual analysis of a selection of Twitter posts from December 3 to 7, 2014, following the nonindictments of officers in the murders of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The debates on Twitter reveal various strategies that youth of color employed to shape the national discourse about race in the wake of these high-profile tragedies.

The efficient information diffusion in their communities ensures wide awareness of updated special events. With agent-based models built on the NetLogo platform, I study information diffusion on online social networks with different simulated network structures. Outcomes from simulated networks and from a case study of real-world Twitter networks show that there exist a range of paired optimal propagation parameters that could mimic real-world information diffusion. It is found that the physical space and the process of information diffusion on the real retweet network over time still demonstrate a geographic pattern showing that a local city or a related city is more involved in a special event in the area.
