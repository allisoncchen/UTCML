Coding and qualitative analyses of a subsample of tweets (N = 9,750) reveal four virtual manhood acts commonly employed to claim elevated status in the heterosexist hierarchy and reproduce gendered inequality. These acts include (1) creation of homosocial, heterosexist space; (2) sexualization of women; (3) signaling possession of a heterosexual, male body; and (4) humor as a tool of oppression. This article introduces the concept of ‚Äúvirtual manhood acts‚Äù and contributes to growing understandings of the reproduction of manhood and the oppression of women in online social spaces.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a form of the Socratic or dialogue approach to explore and comment on various aspects of the tribe mentality that are evident in Dave Ramsey phenomenon. The discourse seeks to deconstruct the alignment of the phenomenon to discover the deeper ideological functions that emanate from the Tribe psychology.

This review presents what is currently known about the way climate change is discussed on Twitter, acknowledging advantages and limitations and suggesting future areas for study. As an accessible platform, Twitter allows public expression of opinions on climate change and provides data on how these fluctuate over different times and places. Moving forward, studies assessing climate views can be improved by better linking them to demographic and other data indicating the population that Twitter users represent. The open‚Äêended content of tweets provides additional information, such as which topics are associated with climate change and which terms are used to discuss it. Future studies can build on these results to capture a wider range of climate‚Äêrelated discussion. Finally, researchers are using Twitter to understand who initiates and participates in climate change dialog and how, by categorizing users as different actors‚Äîsuch as politicians, celebrities, NGOs, or the general public. Future research could consider how effective these efforts are, and how Twitter activity translates to offline outcomes.

The former conceives of the Internet as a new Haberamsian public sphere, that is an open space in which people can freely discuss and deliberate about political issues. The latter deems the Internet as a fragmented and individualized space, which, by definition, destroys any possibility of collective deliberation and discussion. However few scholars have systematically examined the empirical relation between politics and social media. Through a quantitative-qualitative analysis, grounded on the digital methods paradigms and based on a dataset of 181085 tweets collected during the Primarie of Centro Sinistra 2012, we would like to show how Twitter can be conceived of as a civic device that permits a specific political discourse and new forms of political association to be materialized - both entities that would remain unseen otherwise. In the end we suggest that it is possible to construct a new theory of the digital public sphere starting from the Tardian notion of public.

However, the idea that citizen voice through social media can give rise, under given conditions, to a specific digital force combining properties of social movements and public opinion has received less attention. We fill this gap by analysing the digital discussion around the Twitter hashtag #RefugeesWelcome as a case of 'digital movement of opinion' (DMO). When the refugee crisis erupted in 2015, an extraordinary wave of empathy characterized the publics' reactions in key European hosting countries, especially as a result of viral images portraying refugee children as the main victims. Using a triangulation of network, content and metadata analysis, we find that this DMO was driven primarily by social media elites whose tweets were then echoed by masses of isolated users. We then test the post-DMO status of the hashtag-sphere after a potentially antithetical shock such as the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, which polarized the network public. Overall, we argue that the concept of DMO provides a heuristically useful tool for future research on new forms of digital citizen participation.

The increasing popularity of social media raises a number of questions regarding why we use it so much and what aspects influence this activity. What about gender? What about education, income, age or social status? This paper answers some of these questions using statistical analyses and by dividing overall social media use into selected social media, i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitter. The analysis used a dataset that contains information related to 2002 respondents from the U.S. and their social media activity. The results show that people with high household incomes and high education use social media the most. As age increases, social media use decreases, while bigger household income means that social media are used more. Overall, understanding where and at what frequency users are on social media can be a key competitive advantage.

Twitter allows subscribers to write a 140-character status update, called a ‚Äòtweet'. This research analyzes the intersection of microblogging and Canadian politics. There is little scholarship on the political aspects of Twitter. This paper seeks to fill this gap through a content analysis of the most popular Canadian political hashtag, #cdnpoli. Designated by a ‚Äòhash' symbol (#), a hashtag is a keyword assigned to information that describes a tweet and aides in searching. With 50 million tweets per day, hashtags are central to organizing information on Twitter. Hashtags organize discussion around specific topics or events. Political hashtags came to prominence in events like the 2009 Iran presidential election. Indeed, #iranelection was the number one news topic on Twitter in 2009. The popular literature suggests that Twitter is a democratic media because it allows for on-the-ground reporting of breaking news and democratic activism. This analysis shows that informing is the primary function of a political hashtag such as #cdnpoli. Political dialogue and reporting is rare. Contributors scour the internet for relevant online information on Canadian politics and use #cdnpoli as a dissemination feed. The value of a political hashtag derives from the real-time nature of the information shared.

While immigrant advocates were quick to explain the myriad constitutional problems with this proposal, elements of Trump's dream are already a reality. This Article reveals how a single Customs and Border Protection officer can short-circuit the checks and balances prescribed by U.S. and international law to protect refugees from being returned to harm, and cast a long shadow over a future, meritorious asylum claim. In light of the growing attention to the plight of those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum at our borders, this Article examines shortcomings in both law and practice, illuminating the long-lasting ramifications of erroneously issued expedited removal orders for asylum seekers and their families. Congress designed the expedited removal system to expedite deportations and circumvent due process before an immigration judge. Certain humanitarian protections are built into the system to ensure that the United States meets its international and domestic legal obligations not to return refugees to a place where they would face persecution or torture. In practice, these humanitarian protections are too often improperly implemented and front-line border enforcement officials, whether manifesting bias against asylum seekers or lacking proper training and expertise, routinely ignore U.S. law and the Department of Homeland Security's own regulations. This results in the wrongful deportation of asylum seekers and, as revealed in the Article, in permanent negative ramifications for those lucky enough to make it back over the border to in an attempt to re-apply for asylum. The Article examines the disastrous interplay between two of the ""speed deportation"" processes of expedited removal and reinstatement of removal, the lack of sufficient safeguards that leave refugee screening at our borders in the shadows, and the absence of judicial review. The Article seeks not only to expose and analyze this problem, but also to improve the situation by considering a suite of pragmatic, actionable solutions to close the gap between the humanitarian protections prescribed by law and the reality faced by asylum seekers at the U.S. border. As an immediate first step to implement the humanitarian protections enshrined in law, the Article explores the merits and risks of using readily available technology: the use of Body-Worn Cameras by Customs and Border Protection officers conducting screenings of potential refugees at the border to fill the protection gap.

Researchers have raised concerns over the use of social media data in research (for example, boyd and Crawford, 2012; Housley et al, 2014; Tinati et al, 2014), exploring the ontological and epistemological grounding of the emerging field. We contribute to this debate by drawing on Wittgensteinian philosophy to elucidate hitherto neglected aspects; namely that it is not just social scientists who are in the business of analysing social media, but users themselves. We explore how mainstream social media analytics research (1) overinflates the importance of sociological theories, concepts and methodologies (which do not typically feature in the accounts of social media users), (2) downplays the extent to which social media platforms already exhibit order prior to any sociological accounting of them, and, (3) thereby produces findings which explain social scientific perspectives rather than the phenomena themselves. We reformulate the ontological and epistemological basis of social media analytics research from a Wittgensteinian perspective concerned with what it makes sense to say about social media, as members of society and as researchers studying those members. Such a project aims to explore social media users' language as a practice embedded within the context of social life and online communication. This reflects the everyday use of language as an evolving toolkit for undertaking social interaction, pointing towards an alternative conception of social media analytics.",Big Data; BIG DATA; CRISIS; CHALLENGES; social media analytics; epistemology; TWITTER; ontology; ordinary language philosophy; philosophy of social science; Wittgenstein,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

While Earl et al.'s study focuses on research using resource mobilization theory, this study attempts to expand upon their notion by exploring a different theoretical model; the social movement life cycle. Based on my data, I find that the e-movement Anonymous does not fit with the existing life cycle model of social movements. As an e-movement, Anonymous possesses internal dynamics and external goals that are unique from offline movements and even from movements engaging in other types of Internet activism. I propose the theory of strategic abeyance to explain the continuous, adaptable, and dynamic nature of the Anonymous online movement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,SocIndex,-,,,,,,,,-

This paper utilizes multimodal critical discourse analysis and text-mining to examine transnational solidarity efforts between Occupied Palestine and Black communities in the U.S. Through an exploration of tweets, Facebook posts, campaigns, news, and various forms of art, we illustrate the affective intelligence in the political communication (communicative power) between the two groups, drawing connections between their struggles. In addition, this paper illustrates how individual forms of resistance have the power to transform into more powerful forms of collective resistance. Moreover, the paper places the Black strugglein the U.S. and the Palestinian struggle in Occupied Palestine within the larger social context of the global formation of asymmetric wars discussed by Sassen (2010).

This paper examines one particular type of violence that is becoming increasingly popular on social media-urban street fights between Black girls. Although aggression among youth is not at all uncommon, street fights among urban Black girls garner a higher level of attention on social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram) and video sharing sites (e.g. WorldStarHipHop and YouTube). Many of these fights go ""viral"" with over a million online views, and internet users create ""memes"" (digital images or video clips) to dramatize and bring humor to what began as a localized, public altercation. In this paper, I conduct interpretive content analysis on a sample of WorldStarHipHop videos. I examine the politics of street fighting as it relates to actors, videographers, audience members, and public viewers. Ultimately, I argue that WorldStarHipHop participates in a problematic project of misrepresenting urban Black girls as exceptionally violent, reckless, and incorrigible. Rather than contextualizing racial and gender inequality faced by poor black and brown girls, WorldStarHipHop fetishizes violent encounters in urban spaces. This paper contributes new insight to the critical discourse surrounding urban Black girls, violence, and new media. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,SocIndex,-,,,,,,,,-

Simultaneously, Facebook and Twitter have become globally popular and get great influence not only in the virtual world but also in realistic society as the representative type of social media. Whether public intellectuals can expand social influence by using social media? I choose Chinese public intellectuals and Weibo (similar to Twitter in China) as research subjects to represent public intellectuals and social media and use text analysis method. It is found that 65.9% of Chinese public intellectuals have opened Weibo accounts, the average number of followers of their weibo is near to 900,000, and that of being shared and replied to their newest weibo has exceed to 1000. It is showed that public intellectuals broaden their scope of public influence by using weibo. But it is demonstrated in public's comment on their weibo that public opinion has divided into two different parts. Someone welcome public intellectuals and agree with their point, while someone disagree with their weiboes and even insult them. By using Bourdieu's field theory, 'public intellectuals win more public attention but lose public credibility' can be explained by fragmentation, populism, violent discourse as the distinctive rules of weibo field result in the totally different public evaluation. We cannot be too optimistic of public intellectual expanding social influence by using social media.

This derogatory term has been aggressively disseminated by the Chinese government, warning women that they will remain forever single if they do not marry by the time they turn 30. I argue that state-sponsored perpetuation of myths about ""leftover"" women work in conjunction with China's population control policy in an effort to marry off as many young, educated women as possible. The Chinese government views heterosexual marriage as the foundation of a ""harmonious society,"" which is considered essential to maintaining social stability in the midst of widespread inequality and discontent. China faces a looming demographic crisis of tens of millions of men who will be unable to find a bride because of the sex ratio imbalance - roughly 118 boys for every 100 girls -- caused by the abortion of female fetuses. My paper will explore some of the origins, consequences, and resistance to the state campaign about ""leftover"" women. (For example, many young, urban women in China marry in haste out of fear that they may become too old to find another partner.) I draw on in-depth interviews with over 30 women and 20 men in Beijing and Shanghai, content analysis of state media reports, and analysis of comments regarding ""leftover"" women on China's version of Twitter, Sina Weibo.

Differences, tensions and negotiations about gains and losses in this process also mark cultural points of departure and features deemed most significant about them. A US-German comparative study of digital media adoption in professional journalism reveals two tendencies that occur simultaneously but to different degree: 1) diversification of professionalism, which is accompanied by a media environment that is increasingly hybrid and 2) corroboration of professionalism, connected to tendencies of normalizing new technologies. Aside from similar experiences of accelerated news cycles, digital- and particularly social media adoption reflects distinct professional cultures and their responses to the crisis of traditional news media. German journalists in this study reproduced more than altered professional norms through social media while their advent shook the entire conception of what US journalists did, led them to adjust their occupational roles and expand their professional boundaries. Especially Twitter featured US reporters as allowing more transparency of practice. Findings are interpreted according to media systemic differences and distinct, culturally shaped positions journalism inhabits in these civil societies. This paper is based on ethnographic research of two groups of political reporters in the US and Germany. Field research stretched from spring of 2009 to summer of 2012, set at state governments in Albany, New York and Munich, Bavaria, involving participant observation, 72 interviews with journalists (from 31 different news organization) and spokespeople (across all political parties and branches of government).

Some preliminary studies suggest that social media has begun to blur the lines between private and public mourning, encouraging users to maintain continuing bonds with the deceased, and helping mourners establish community with one another. However, these early studies have primarily examined highly personalized social media spaces such as Facebook and MySpace. It is possible that the ways in which death and mourning is addressed and/or happens via social media sites varies according to the features of particular sites. In this paper, we analyze the tweet-feeds of deceased Twitter users and find that social processes surrounding death and mourning on Twitter are more diverse than early studies of social media suggest. We find that Twitter users engage in a unique blend of public and private behavior pertaining to death and mourning. While some users directly engage with the deceased and display evidence of ""continuing bonds"", others use Twitter to comment on ""high profile"" instances of death - often connecting these deaths to other topics of interest or broad discussions of death and mortality. Overall, our findings suggest that Twitter has broadened the scope of conversations about death and remembrance in contemporary Western culture by fostering social processes that embody a blend of interpersonal and broadcast-based communication. We categorize these processes along a spectrum that ranges from highly personal, intimate communications to broadcast-based, abstracted commenting.
