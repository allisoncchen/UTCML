This description provided a baseline for establishing current awareness of moral injury as a source of traumatic stress. In February 2016, we searched seven scholarly databases for use of the term moral injury. Seventy-nine articles met our search criteria. Time comparisons revealed a significant increase in the number of scholarly articles published within the last 5 years. We also searched the social media platform Twitter for use of ""#moralinjury."" Appearing first in 2011, this hashtag saw an 86% increase in use by 2016. Further results revealed that most research is performed in the United States, is dominated by psychologists, and is focused on the military. Our findings reflect an increased awareness of the trauma of moral injury, but future research needs to address international and interdisciplinary work across populations.

This study used classic (Glaserian) grounded theory methodology to explore the experiences and concerns of mental health professionals on social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The main concern that emerged out of research interviews with 26 mental health professionals was a loss of control over others' perceptions and the loss of ability to compartmentalize the different parts of identities associated with personal and professional selves. Participants resolved these concerns through the author-identified basic social process of ""managing digital identities."" This study highlights practice implications for professionals as they manage online identity.

The shift from a top-down, provider-generated Web 1.0 towards the bottom-up user-generated Web 2.0 is a trend towards unpredictability, incalculability, inefficiency and less subject to external control; a deMcDonaldization of the Web. These conclusions stem from an analysis of Web 2.0, such as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), media sharing sites (e.g., Flickr, YouTube), open source software (e.g., Linux, Firefox), Wikipedia, blogs and the blogosphere (including Twitter) and so on. It is argued here that the mechanism that allows the trend towards deMcDonaldization is the relative lack of scarcity in digital and user-generated environment as compared to the material world that the concept was created to describe. However, this argument is tempered by the fact that much of the Internet is highly rationalized. Many of the sites that allow for unpredictable user-generated content do so precisely because of their rationalized and standardized, thus McDonaldized, underlying structure. For example, Facebook, eBay and Wikipedia pages look and behave similarly for all users. Thus the conclusion is nuanced: that rationality and irrationality can comfortably coexist online, arguably due to the relative lack of scarcity. This conclusion, born out of abundance, is not possible under the McDonaldization thesis that was centered in a material world of scarcity.

However, contributions that apply ecological visions to protest are scattered, and only seldom connect their analyses to more general media ecological frameworks. The article critically reviews and classifies the diverse strands of scholarship that adopt the ecological metaphor in their exploration of activism, and connects them with the more general literature on media and communication ecologies. Moreover, it extracts the constitutive elements of this literature that can help scholars to better address the complexity of communication within social movements, and it articulates four key lessons that a media ecology lens brings to the understanding of media and protest. Finally, the article further demonstrates the strengths of this approach through an illustration of the preliminary findings of an ongoing investigation on the 15M movement in Spain.",digital activism; social movements; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; YOUTUBE; literature review; TWITTER; Media ecologies; protest ecologies,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

The present study investigated how people use interpersonal (i.e., phone calling, texting, video chatting) and masspersonal media (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) for different purposes (i.e., social connection, entertainment, information seeking) during the pandemic. Further, we examined how such mediated communication is associated with users' loneliness and, in turn, satisfaction with life. Results showed that people preferred interpersonal media for social connection and masspersonal media for entertainment and information seeking. The use of interpersonal and masspersonal media and its purpose were associated with users' psychological well-being both positively and negatively. Social use of interpersonal media was associated with decreased loneliness and, in turn, increased satisfaction with life.

For just as long, some Black women have resisted their mischaracterizations. Instead they have embraced a 'fat' identity. But little research has demonstrated how Black fat women participate in sport. The purpose of this study is to show how Black fat women who run use social media to unapologetically celebrate Blackness and fatness. This research uses a case-study approach to illuminate a broader phenomenon of decolonial resistance through running. In addition to analysis of websites, blogs, and news articles devoted to Black women's running, we discuss the (social) media content of two specific runners: Mirna Valerio and Latoya Shauntay Snell. We performed a critical discourse analysis on 14 media offerings from the two runners, including websites, Twitter pages, and blogs collected over a five-month period from September 2020-January 2021. The analysis examined how they represent themselves and their communities and how they comment on issues of anti-fat bias, neoliberal capitalism, ableist sexism, and white supremacy, some of the pillars of colonialism. Whereas running is often positioned as a weight-loss-focused and white-dominated colonial project, through their very presence and use of strategic communication to amplify their experiences and build community, these runners show how being a Black fat female athlete is an act of decolonial resistance. This study offers a unique sporting example of how fat women challenge obesity discourses and cultural invisibility and how Black athletes communicate anti-racist, decolonial principles.",MEDIA; POLITICS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; HEALTH; sport; critical discourse analysis; women; NEOLIBERALISM; OBESITY; BODY-IMAGE; CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; decolonize; fatness; running; SPEAKING; WEIGHT,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

Twitter is one of many online platforms used by parents of children diagnosed with cancer to share information related to their child‚Äôs cancer experience. Existing research suggests that there is a need to better understand the motives for using Twitter for sharing content about a child‚Äôs cancer experience. Furthermore, there is a lack of theoretical frameworks for characterizing those motives. In this paper, we identify key themes of tweets posted by parents of children diagnosed with cancer and align those themes with motives inspired by the well-studied Everyday Life Information Seeking framework. We propose a new motive in addition to those associated with the framework and suggest that information can be shared for endogenous reasons as well as to meet the needs of others. This paper contributes an increased understanding of motives for sharing information about a child‚Äôs cancer journey and extends a theoretical framework for building further knowledge in this area.

In this paper, we analyse mentions of deceased Twitter users and find that Twitter facilitates multiple types of mourning behaviours previously identified in isolation within other online spaces. While some Twitter users engage directly with the deceased and display evidence of continuing bonds, others use Twitter to comment on the death of high profile individuals or individuals whose death sparked their interest ‚Äì often connecting these deaths to broader topics, including current events and calls for social change. Overall, our findings suggest that Twitter is a unique online space that encourages users to engage in a variety of personal and public communication that ranges from highly personal and intimate interaction to abstracted and impersonal commenting.

Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p =.0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02‚Äì1.09, p =.00258). Medical Twitter experienced a 37% quarterly increase in destigmatizing tweet frequency (IRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15‚Äì1.64, p =.00291), and Public Health a 16% increase (IRR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.11‚Äì1.20, p =0.00000000373). Unfortunately, a regression discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Health's use of destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19. While the longitudinal findings are promising, they also indicate a need for increased efforts to encourage broader use of destigmatizing language, especially post-COVID.

To understand this phenomenon, we tracked a comprehensive collection of political rumors on Twitter during the 2012 US presidential election campaign, analyzing a large set of rumor tweets (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ330,538). We found that Twitter helped rumor spreaders circulate false information within homophilous follower networks, but seldom functioned as a self-correcting marketplace of ideas. Rumor spreaders formed strong partisan structures in which core groups of users selectively transmitted negative rumors about opposing candidates. Yet, rumor rejecters neither formed a sizable community nor exhibited a partisan structure. While in general rumors resisted debunking by professional fact-checking sites (e.g. Snopes), this was less true of rumors originating with satirical sources.

Using content analysis that combines both quantitative and qualitative method-ologies, we analysed the posts (N=386) uploaded to the official Instagram accounts of the main candidates for president of the Spanish government during the electoral campaigns for the two general elections held in 2019. This enabled us to meet the main objective of the study, which was to verify whether the Instagram platform is prone to hosting political messages and discussions of a populist nature. Likewise, in order to obtain a wider perspec-tive of both campaigns on the same social network, the issues forming the subject of each candidates' agendas in the same period were studied. The main results show that Instagram, like Twitter and Facebook, enables political leaders to spread messages that in essence carry a populist narrative; to use the social network as a means of electoral propaganda; and largely to avoid discussing the proposals of their political agendas.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICAL COMMUNICATION; political leaders; FACEBOOK; populism; DISCOURSE; social networks; MEDIATIZATION; PARTIES; TWITTER; IMAGE; DISCURSIVE STRATEGY; general elections; GENERAL-ELECTION; thematic agenda,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

Starting late 2012, India experienced increased GBV-related media attention, when a young Delhi woman was fatally gang raped. Public outcry ensued through Twitter. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, can erode social boundaries and permit persons to challenge social norms and the status quo. Moreover, Twitter may provide a virtual safe space in which women in India can voice their opinions about GBV and press for social change. This article shares findings from research exploring ways in which men and women used Twitter in the aftermath of the Delhi rape case, focusing on the conversations around GBV that took place, and the opportunities that Twitter offers for more strategic engagement of individuals, especially women, to press for social change.

The central claim of this essay is that the DWSN is an experiment in power/freedom, an attempt to simultaneously trace, deploy, and overcome the historical conditions in which it finds itself: the generic constraints and affordances of social networking as they have been developed over the past decade by Facebook and Twitter, and the ideological constraints and affordances of public perceptions of the dark web, which hold that the dark web is useful for both taboo activities and freedom from state oppression. I trace the DWSN‚Äôs experiment with power/freedom through three practices: anonymous/social networking, the banning of child pornography, and the productive aspects of techno-elitism. I then use these practices to specify particular forms of power/freedom on the DWSN.

This is partly due to the tendency to minimise accusations of sexism and to reframe misogyny as 'acceptable' by constructing it as a form of humour. We decided to focus on slut-shaming, one of the most virulent forms of hate speech, which has always existed but was boosted by social media, becoming a stable low-cost ingredient of today's rape culture. We propose to consider online slut-shaming as a form of 'technology-facilitated sexual violence', where digital technologies are used to facilitate both virtual and face-to-face sexually based harms. According to feminist analysis of sexual violence, this would be a matter of power rather than sex: sex would be the weapon, not the motive. We have tested this research hypothesis by focusing on the Italian reception of the MeToo campaign, triggered by Asia Argento's denunciation. More specifically, two Different Twitter corpora produced within the same five months period were examined by means of a quantitative and a qualitative methodology.

It is interesting to examine how such organizations tie their theoretical conception of citizenship (their ‚Äòoffline‚Äô philosophy) to the choices they make about web presence (their ‚Äòonline‚Äô structure). Web presence ‚Äì in this case, websites but also the use of Web 2.0 applications ‚Äì can aim to provide information and promote participation, but can also encourage a particular view of citizenship and use certain forms of communication to advance this view. This paper focuses on seven youth organizations that embrace either a more conventional or non-conventional view of citizenship and have expanded their web presence from a dedicated website into Web 2.0, particularly social networking sites. First, I will summarize interview findings with web producers to better understand the philosophy behind web presence of the youth organization, along with a look at official website content. Second, I will provide a first look at how such organizations have adapted to Web 2.0, specifically via Facebook and Twitter. This paper contributes to an understanding of how online spaces and in particular the adaptation to Web 2.0 reflect offline views towards citizenship, a particularly important focus in an environment of increasing concern as to how to reach youth via technology.

Interoperability between major online social network services holds great potential for linking a broad range of platforms, spaces, and people together in exciting new ways. Open APIs support interoperability by providing the tools to share data used to develop popular and useful Web applications, achieve seamless integration of social media services, and give rise to mutually beneficial third-party developer ecosystems that build on top of social media platforms. Yet, while Open APIs provide new ways of sharing and participating, they also provide a means for companies like Facebook to achieve market dominance, as well as undermine privacy, data security, contextual integrity, user autonomy and freedom. This paper examines interoperability enabled by Open APIs among competing online services (Facebook, Google, YouTube, MySpace and Twitter) to identify the tenuous push and pull of competition and cooperation. The author provides a summary and analysis of Facebook's Open API releases over the last five years, to determine the underlying conditions for sharing and identify the social implications of their technical features. This paper concludes by suggesting ways that users can make more informed decisions about their sharing and perhaps change the underlying conditions of interoperability all together by developing more secure and user controllable social networks, Open APIs, and online applications.

In the first one rejection was predominant over acceptance and neutrality. Rejection was smaller in the second one, showing how fluctuant these expressions are depending the media context. In both cases rejection toward migrants was significantly bigger than over refugees, as it had already been observed in international contexts. This work also created a training corpus about immigrant rejection, valid for future studies, and observed the negative aspects most frequently associated to rejection of immigrants, as well as the relationship existing between this and the fact of tweets being information or opinion.
