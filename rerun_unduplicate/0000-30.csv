This study constitutes a wide-ranging investigation that explores how Twitter's platform has been used in the debate regarding whether mixed-gender friendships should be allowed in the Saudi context. Adopting the tools of critical discourse analysis, the study analyses the detailed discourses and discursive strategies pertaining to mixed-gender friendship in a hashtag thread of 8050 tweets collected in September 2020. Overall, the hashtag describes the public reaction and debate with respect to mixed-gender friendship in Saudi Arabia, simultaneously highlighting the contribution of the evoked tweeted arguments in raising awareness of mixed-gender friendship restrictions imposed under the configuration of religious, social, and political discourses. The data analyzed demonstrates that the differences in arguments concerning mixed-gender friendships within the forms of dissent and protest are in a dialogically supportive relation with dominant political, religious, and social conservative discourses.

We use placebo analyses, performing the same analysis but with tweets assumed to be unrelated to presidential approval, to assess the relationship and conclude that the relationship is less strong than it might otherwise seem. Secondly, we suggest following users longitudinally, which enables us to find evidence of a political signal around the 2016 presidential election. For the goal of supplementing traditional surveys with social media data, our results are encouraging, but cautionary.

However, how expression facilitates those values is underexplored. This Article proposes a doctrinal framework of free speech consisting of four parts: right of control over one‚Äôs information, right to know, right of access to platforms, and behavioral rules of public discussion. These are the constitutive parts that are necessary for the exercise of free speech to be meaningful and effective. After elaborating on these elements, this Article tests the framework by analyzing four cases: the European Union‚Äôs Right to Be Forgotten, the information disclosure laws of China, the blocking of Trump‚Äôs Twitter account, and the Indian hate speech incident. Those four cases offer a more comprehensive scenario as to how the quadruple framework operates in real contexts.

To do this, I analyzed tweets containing the phrase ""ang tunay na lalake"" (the real man) and the hashtag ""# angtunaynalalake"". Using qualitative content analysis, the following themes were generated: 1) Romance and Masculinities which highlights heteronormativity of romantic context and the concept of ""more deserving real man"" - a construct produced through networked masculinity and within the context of fandom and bigotry; 2) Masculine Capital - highlights how rites of passage, specifically circumcision, can be overshadowed by masculine capital to the point that failing to meet the required masculine capital would render one as 'de-circumcised'; and lastly, 3) Online Resistance to Hegemonic Masculinity - shows the use of jokes, sarcasm, and confrontation in questioning hegemonic masculinity.

Traditional machine learning models may encounter problems when used in such a context, due to the peculiarities of microblogging sites and the manner in which these networks interact (both between themselves and with other networks). Moreover, state-of-the-art approaches have focused on non-transparent techniques that cannot be audited; so, despite the fact that they are top performing techniques, it is impossible to check if the models are actually fair. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised methodology that uses our Discriminatory Expressions algorithm for feature selection to detect expressions that are biased towards extremist content (Francisco and Castro 2020). With the help of human experts, the relevant expressions are filtered and used to retrieve further extremist content in order to iteratively provide a set of relevant and accurate expressions. These discriminatory expressions have been proved to produce less complex models that are easier to comprehend, and thus improve model transparency. In the following, we present close to 70 expressions that were discovered by using this method alongside the validation test of the algorithm in several different contexts.

In this context, then, #MeToo took an understandably collective turn, translating the hashtag from an individually voiced ""Me Too"" centering on the experience of victimization to a collective ""I Too Accuse"", echoing this tradition of speak-outs. This other approach actually offers the benefits of more expansive and certainly a less blindered view of feminist activism and the #MeToo movement. The feverish mobilization around the Twitter hashtag #MeToo occurred relatively recently, in 2017, but events since then provoke a distanced vantage point from which to view the movement anew.

But to the physically disabled, knowledge is more appropriately identified with empowerment. That is a fine distinction but one that has profound implications. The former implies control over others; the latter conveys control over ones own life. Ramps, curb cuts, accessible entrances and bathrooms, public transportation, Braille signs, and crosswalks for the hearing impaired are all significant strides toward inclusion mandated by those in power. They make mobility possible for those with diverse physical disabilities. They do not necessarily empower; for that to occur a person must have knowledge of the enabling adaptation. Will there be curb cuts along my path? Will the building's entrance be accessible? Which bathrooms are accessible? Will the elevator be in service? Questions like these are addressed daily by those with disabilities who endeavor to go about their day unencumbered with the matter-of-fact attitude of the physically abled. At the University of Tennessee we are proposing a suite of integrated information systems that would provide a variety of archival resources as well as real-time information for the disabled in need of navigation assistance. This system would leverage existing technology, such as Google maps, GPS navigation, Twitter and other internet resources to develop site-specific, real-time resources that address a variety of mobility issues.

Thanks to an active community of online commentators made up primarily of academics, researchers, staff of non-governmental organizations and journalists, Twitter is a vibrant place to monitor the pulse of international criminal law generally and the International Criminal Court specifically. Twitter, thus, uniquely elevates a comparatively small commentator class and amplifies their narratives about the field of international criminal justice. Yet with an apparent lack of voices from across the diverse community of practitioners, or the input of diplomats and technocrats who make the field possible, commentators may exert a disproportionate influence over public perceptions of international criminal justice. Cognisant of the stark interplay between politics and law in international criminal justice ‚Äî often including powerful forces with nefarious agendas ‚Äî and an abundance of individuals motivated by a desire to be seen and heard, this community may at times exhibit problematic behaviours (unwittingly or otherwise).

The purpose of the present study was to identify and discuss Ban the Box-related themes in a sample of Twitter posts. Using the social media platform Twitter, researchers collected a 58-day sample of public posts that used the hashtag Ban the Box (#BantheBox). A qualitative thematic analysis was used to assess the content of tweets to identify underlying themes related to the Ban the Box movement. Two researchers independently coded the contents of each original tweet (N=204) and reached consensus on identified themes. Results showed two underlying themes: first, risky business or the perceived risks businesses take in hiring persons with prior justice system involvement, and second, that individuals with prior justice system involvement are a vulnerable population. This study highlights how Twitter is used to communicate about social justice-related issues. Further, this paper serves as a call to action for policymakers, social workers, and researchers to consider this medium when advocating for individuals with prior justice system involvement.

It argues that because of geographical and social mobility experiences, families have not remained static, and consequently, the further they go from the village the more modernized they become. In recent times, African societies as well as family histories have been concerned with connecting with those who have been left behind. As a result, the blueprint that marks out the African family today is found in its mobility both within and out of the continent. At the same time, what glues the family together is the newer forms of technologies encapsulated in Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), which include amongst many others the cell phone, internet, WhatsApp, and Twitter. Letters pre-dated these new technologies and were significantly used by migrant families to stay ""in touch"". Families began in the village, and as newer technologies were introduced-motor cars, a postal service and motorable roads-they moved or thought about places further away. With later technological developments, such as air travel and the mobile phone, families found themselves in distant diasporic spaces. This paper therefore hopes to make a contribution that relates family history and the history of migration to technology and social change. It also has the great value of discussing an area that gets too little attention in historiography. Fundamentally, the paper attempts to compare and contrast the use of technology, the news that could be shared (welfare, births, or obituaries), the length between contacts, the ability to make visits in person, the tensions that cropped up between family members abroad and those back at home in two periods, the 1930s-1940s and the 1990s to the present. What did these periods have in common? What was different and why? For the purpose of clarity, I will start the paper with a short introduction about the area, the issues of family formation, and kfaang. The second part of the paper will focus on the discussion of the ""newness"" of those who migrated to more modern places and the role of technology. The third part compares/contrasts the connections of families in the two periods (1930s-1940s and 1990s-present) in order to flesh out the argument.",communication technology; modernity; family; Cameroon; kfaang; Kom,WOS,N/A,,,,,,,,0

While this categorisation does not presuppose discrimination in itself, it appears to be a precondition for discursive discrimination. COVID-19 age-related risks have particularly exacerbated ageism on social media, fuelling discourses driven by intergenerational tension. Despite the importance of social media in contemporary communication, there is still scant research on the representation of ageism in these environments. This paper attempts to fill this void by exploring millennials' use of the derogatory Twitter hashtags #BoomerDoomer and #BoomerRemover to discriminate 'baby boomers' as the COVID-19 risk group. Informed by Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) showing interest in discriminatory discourse in the media, the study aims at disclosing the main themes and discursive strategies used to construe ageist content in a sample of original tweets posted during the initial stage of the disease outbreak when the hashtags were trending. Framed by a CDA taxonomy of discriminatory discursive strategies, the combined thematic and discourse analysis highlights how the chosen topics and discursive strategies subtly perpetuate ageism, thus suggesting its resurgence in the COVID-19 era.

The nature of these firms is particularly in focus as their main marketing strategy is based on selling intangible products with a promise to effect business change. The implication is that potential clients often choose a service firm based on who they feel they can trust, suggesting that success for these corporations comes down to creating a brand that is relevant to clients, believable in its claims, and able to deliver on its promises. In particular, the study examines how the Big Four create narrative content across multiple digital media platforms and, for this purpose, a corpus of linguistic and visual data extracted from company websites and Twitter accounts is analysed by employing the theory of social semiotics and using multimodal critical discourse analysis. The data ensembles are examined with a special emphasis on how storytelling strategies are embedded in texts and images, and strategically constructed to legitimise specific social practices realised in discursive representations of each firm's identity.

The aim of this paper is to develop a systemic risk model which, differently from existing ones, employs not only the information contained in financial market prices, but also big data coming from financial tweets. From a methodological viewpoint, we propose a new framework, based on categorical graphical models, that can estimate systemic risks with models based on two different sources: financial markets and financial tweets, and suggest a way to combine them, using a Bayesian approach. From an applied viewpoint, we present the first systemic risk model based on big data, and show that such a model can shed further light on the interrelationships between financial institutions. This can help predicting the level of returns of a bank, conditionally on the others, for example when a shock occurs in another bank.

Many scholars have supported the idea that the politicians are using social media to build their political image and are not doing much to create a relationship and discourse with their voters. This also strengthen the prevailing idea that regardless of the potential advantages, politicians tend to hesitate the active involvement of online users (Hoffmann and Suphan, 2017).The primary goal of this study is to explore a relationship between the posts and tweets of the Members of National Assembly of Pakistan (MNAs) and the audience involvement by investigating the type of Facebook posts and tweets that generate more audience engagement. The analysis of audience engagement would help politicians to know what they should post and what should be avoided if they want to have more followers and cultivate a lifelong relationship with their audience.

The data analyzed consisted of a random sample of 100 Instagram pictures (visual) and 100 tweets (lexical) that employed the DACA hashtag (#DACA) three days preceding January 21, 2018. In our analysis, several themes such as expansive and restrictive views of equality, responsibility, and culpability for the DACA crisis have emerged. We articulate that Instagram and Twitter have similarities and differences between visual and textual representations surrounding DACA.

This study presents the results of a content analysis of tweets using racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Islamic and homophobic language. Tweet content is considered using a framework from prior court cases: does a tweet constitute political speech; contribute to the marketplace of ideas; encourage violence or include threats? The results show that messages of hate can be communicated without using overly offensive words; and that Twitter users discuss who should vs. should not use a word. Study findings are considered in the context of the U.S. having become more divided politically, and social media's role in amplifying racists' messaging.

A Case Study Observing Social Media Engagement Around Vaccinations,Health Promotion Practice,10.1177/1524839919899925,https://doi-org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/10.1177/1524839919899925,"In the early 2000s, there was a shift in the use of the internet. Individuals on the internet began seeking information from other creators and creating their own content. These online communities allowed individuals to communicate across the globe, gravitating toward people like them or those who shared similar beliefs. Conversations around vaccinations have been particularly polarizing across social media even though scientific literature continually validates their safety and effectiveness. This study will explore whether online public discourse about vaccinations changes before and after major scientific publications, and will measure what is related to social engagement around vaccinations on Twitter. In September 2018, two weeks‚Äô worth of Twitter posts (n = 2,919) discussing vaccinations were collected, coded, and analyzed before and after two major 2014 scientific publications. Linear regression analyses examined variables related to engagement with vaccination-related Tweets pre- and postpublication. Antivaccine-related Tweets decreased by over 25% after scientific publications, while provaccine Tweets increased by 16.6%. Regression models suggest verification status and number of followers were the strongest predictors of Twitter engagement. Findings indicate that scientific publications might affect what people public health information people share online, and how people engage with online content. In a time when false information is easily spread online, this study suggests the need for continual scientific publication on ‚Äúhot topics,‚Äù and urges researchers to partner with influential individuals on social media to disseminate effective, evidence-based, and user-friendly public health information to the public.",,SAGE,N/A,,,,,,,,0
