However, such measures are complex when established borders are open yet politically contested, as for the border that divides the Republic of Ireland (ROI) from Northern Ireland (NI). Understanding how this border affected the everyday lives of both populations during the pandemic is important for informing the continued development of effective responses to COVID-19 and future health crises. This multi-methods study aimed to explore public perspectives on how the ROI-NI border affected experiences of and responses to the 'first wave' of the pandemic. The study collated data from focus groups (n = 8), news articles (n = 967), and Twitter posts (n = 356) on the island of Ireland, which mentioned the ROI-NI border in relation to COVID-19. Thematic analysis was used to explore the range of perspectives on the role played by the border during the early months of the pandemic. Analysis identified three themes: Cross-Border Interdependencies illustrated the complexity and challenges of living near the border; Interpretations of Cross-Border Policy Disparities showed that lay publics perceived NI and ROI policy approaches as discordant and politicised; and Responses to Cross-Border Policy Disparities revealed alternating calls to either strengthen border controls, or pursue a unified all-island approach. Results reveal clear public appetite for greater synchronisation of cross-border pandemic responses, emphasise the specific vulnerability of communities living near the border, and highlight the risk of long-term socio-political repercussions of border management decisions taken during the pandemic. Findings will inform implementation of pandemic responses and public health policies in jurisdictions that share a porous land border. • Open international land borders have complicated responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. • This study explored lay perspectives on the border on the island of Ireland. • Findings illustrated the challenges of living near the border during the pandemic. • Public discourse positioned cross-border policies as divergent and politicised. • There was wide support for a unified all-island approach to COVID-19.

Patients, many with initially 'mild' illness, used various kinds of evidence and advocacy to demonstrate a longer, more complex course of illness than laid out in initial reports from Wuhan. Long Covid has a strong claim to be the first illness created through patients finding one another on Twitter: it moved from patients, through various media, to formal clinical and policy channels in just a few months. This initial mapping of Long Covid – by two patients with this illness – focuses on actors in the UK and USA and demonstrates how patients marshalled epistemic authority. Patient knowledge needs to be incorporated into how COVID-19 is conceptualised, researched, and treated. • Patients made visible the persistence and heterogeneity of COVID-19 symptoms. • Patients experiencing long-term symptoms ('long-haulers') made Long Covid. • Long Covid challenges early clinical and governmental assumptions about Covid. • Knowledge travelled from patients through media to formal health and policy channels. • Patient expertise and knowledge should be incorporated in the pandemic evidence base.

It then goes on to discuss how a crowd-based approach offers a supplementary perspective to contemporary studies of populism, on the one hand, and to accounts that primarily focus on the role of social media in organizing political protest movements, on the other. An analysis of crowds not only avoids both methodological holism and methodological individualism. It also helps to understand why so many people were mobilized beyond the power of concepts, ideologies and discourse.

This article investigates the phenomenon of the Egyptian diaspora through an innovative approach based on an analysis of the digital activity and the presence of Egyptian connected migrants. Following the methodology of the e-Diaspora project, we found a weakly connected network of websites, with many isolated nodes, little clusterization and no authorities or hubs. The fact that the traditional approach of the e-diaspora yielded few results prompted us to follow a new research strategy combining data from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. Because of a particularly fortuitous coincidence with the Egyptian revolt, we could investigate the mobilization of Egyptian migrants in pursuit of their voting rights on the micro-blogging platform Twitter. Through Twitter data, we identified links that were not visible through traditional Web-mapping techniques, and we could observe the emergence of a transnational Egyptian community debating and fighting for a common cause.

It came to public attention around the turn of the millennium when the human genome began to be deciphered. Initial findings from epigenetics research held the promise of changing how we think about health and illness, evolution and heredity; speculations about how individuals and populations could begin to control such processes through epigenetics were then picked up in the public realm. In this article we concentrate on two normally distant domains within the public sphere: the advertising of alternative health products and services, and the promotion of alternative approaches to social science, especially around how social science deals with the 'biosocial'. Using insights from social representations theory and methods aligned with metaphor analysis, we investigate the meanings of epigenetics rooted in the use of metaphors and commonplaces that are circulating in current popular parlance and that are used to promote academic theories and ideas as well as tangible products and services. We compare and contrast them and assess their implications for collaborations between natural and social scientists. Our findings reveal some surprising similarities between the metaphors and commonplaces used by advertisers and social scientists, based in large part on the fact that both groups draw on the work of prominent epigeneticists. In both instances some fundamental tenets of mainstream biology are contested, and hopes are created for improving individual or population well-being through the manipulation of epigenetic mechanisms. Both domains share some misunderstandings of epigenetics that might lead to problems with interdisciplinary collaborations between social and natural scientists.

However, the intensity of online networks for both campaigns was lower than for the country’s last presidential election, in 2007, suggesting that the web ecology of a given election is influenced by the perceived importance of the event and the general popularity of certain candidates. The results also suggest that producing and disseminating information, such as news articles, blog posts and tweets, reflects a more politically conscious action than referring to information via hyperlinks.

A survey of Korean journalists supported that TPB is a useful theoretical framework for understanding journalists’ Twitter use behaviors. This study found that three TPB variables – positive attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control – are positively associated with journalists’ general Twitter use (i.e., time spent using Twitter). More importantly, beyond looking at journalists’ general Twitter use, this study expands the literature by distinguishing between expressive Twitter use (e.g., tweeting messages) and consumptive Twitter use (e.g., reading others’ tweets). Results showed that journalists’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls were associated differently depending on patterns of expressive and consumptive Twitter usage. Given the role of professional journalists in society, their ways of using Twitter may have a profound impact on the ecology of journalism. Contributing to the literature of the theory of planned behavior by extending its explanatory power to professional journalists’ Twitter usage, the results of this study suggest that future research on journalists’ Twitter use should pay more attention to how Twitter is employed within the journalistic context.

Twitter represents a social media venue that provides an immediate and direct link between the Member of Congress (MC) and constituents, which entails a benefit and a potential risk. In this paper, I examine Twitter use in the 111th Congress in order to better understand congressional early adoption of new technology. The primary question addressed is what systematic determinants shape the decision to adopt Twitter as a component of an MC''s media strategy. Using data collected from MC Twitter accounts and the 2008 congressional election, I find partisan, cohort, and ideological determinants on early Twitter adoption. Republicans are more likely to use Twitter even in multivariate analysis; ideological extremism influences the use of Twitter. In contrast to past technologies, district demographics have no systematic effect on the early adoption of Twitter.

By relying on social network analysis (SNA) methods, this study examines how news/opinions diffuse and how they interact and influence each other's ideological frame within agencies sharing the same ideology and between agencies whose ideologies contrast. The results show that public discourse on the Internet is clearly polarized and fragmented along political ideological lines. Additionally, the findings show that the winner is the conservative bloc because it succeeds in achieving within-bloc solidarity and ensures the resonance of news frames with the cultural values of Korean society.

Methods: This study employs social network analyses based on 2,864 Twitter users and 2,775 communications of Twitter. Results: This study finds that President Trump plays the most important role in social networks among the top 20 key players for both in‐degree centrality and content in tweets. Second, Donald Trump and Barak Obama show the opposite result for the in‐degree centrality and follower analysis. The result shows that the topic‐based networks and the person‐based networks play a different role in social networks. This study demonstrates that the presidents, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, the Centers for Disease Control, and news channels play a crucial role in the news of COVID‐19 for people. Key players, such as Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and BBC, are located in the central networks. In contrast, U.S. news channels and WHO and its regional offices have independent channels. Conclusions: Governments should understand the characteristics of public key players to provide information for COVID‐19 in a timely manner.

1774,journalArticle,2015.0,"Mikeska, Jessica; Harvey, Elise Johansen",The Political CEO: An Event Study Comparing Consumer Attributions of CEO Behavior.,Social Science Quarterly (Wiley-Blackwell),,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=101158488&site=ehost-live,"Objective We sought to establish a relationship between negative political behavior of key firm members and consumer evaluations of the firm through an attribution theories extension. Method We sample and code approximately 1,500 Tweets surrounding Dan Cathy's political beliefs about marriage and Taco Bell's response to a lawsuit regarding beef. Results Consumers are more likely to attribute a volitional event (CEO political disapproval) toward the firm than toward societal elements. However, consumers experienced a greater degree of negative affect following the situational than the volitional event. Conclusion While none of the consumers who attributed this situation toward Taco Bell also communicated decisions to no longer return for Taco Bell products, approximately 15 percent of the consumers who attributed Dan Cathy's political beliefs toward Chick-fil-A communicated intentions to no longer return to Chick-fil-A. A firm operated by a political CEO could lose 15 percent of all its consumers.

1775,journalArticle,2022.0,"Reynolds, Celene","The diffusion of federal Title IX complaints throughout U.S. colleges and universities, 1994–2014.",Social Science Research,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=159979901&site=ehost-live,"This article uses an original dataset of federal Title IX complaints to assess whether and how mobilization of the law to confront sexual harassment has diffused throughout four-year (and above) nonprofit colleges and universities. Event history analyses show that complaints spread more rapidly among schools of similar selectivity as well as among institutions linked by a new indicator for social proximity—school Twitter ties—that encompasses multiple forms of social proximity simultaneously. The same diffusion patterns do not emerge for other types of sex discrimination complaints filed under Title IX, indicating that networks channel the capacity to mobilize law differently across different types of claims. The findings illuminate a dramatic transformation in the deployment of Title IX that has reshaped how colleges and universities govern gender relations.

1776,journalArticle,2016.0,"Shi, Yongren; Macy, Michael",Measuring structural similarity in large online networks.,Social Science Research,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=117269814&site=ehost-live,"Structural similarity based on bipartite graphs can be used to detect meaningful communities, but the networks have been tiny compared to massive online networks. Scalability is important in applications involving tens of millions of individuals with highly skewed degree distributions. Simulation analysis holding underlying similarity constant shows that two widely used measures – Jaccard index and cosine similarity – are biased by the distribution of out-degree in web-scale networks. However, an alternative measure, the Standardized Co-incident Ratio (SCR), is unbiased. We apply SCR to members of Congress, musical artists, and professional sports teams to show how massive co-following on Twitter can be used to map meaningful affiliations among cultural entities, even in the absence of direct connections to one another. Our results show how structural similarity can be used to map cultural alignments and demonstrate the potential usefulness of social media data in the study of culture, politics, and organizations across the social and behavioral sciences.

Drawing on the case of the Occupy Wall Street movement, we examine the impact of Facebook and Twitter on the spatial diffusion of protests during a period of heightened state repression. Results from event history analyses suggest that the effects of repression on protest diffusion are contingent on the presence of social media accounts supporting the movement. We find that state repression at earlier protest sites encouraged activists to create Facebook and Twitter accounts in their own cities, which then served as important vehicles for the initiation of new Occupy protests. Moreover, results suggest that repression incidents can directly facilitate future protests in cities that already have Occupy Facebook accounts. This study highlights the potential of social media to both mediate and moderate the influence of repression on the diffusion of contemporary movements.

1779,journalArticle,2017.0,"Murthy, D; Gross, AJ",Social media processes in disasters: Implications of emergent technology use,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.09.015,,"This article seeks to extend social science scholarship on social media technology use during disruptive events. Though social media's role in times of crisis has been previously studied, much of this work tends to focus on first-responders and relief organizations. However, social media use during disasters tends to be decentralized and this organizational structure can promote different types of messages to top-down information systems. Using 142,786 geo-tagged tweets collected before and after Hurricane Sandy's US landfall as a case study, this article seeks to explore shifts in social media behavior during disruptive events and highlights that though Sandy disrupted routine life within Twitter, users responded to the disaster by employing humor, sharing photos, and checking into locations. We conclude that social media use during disruptive events is complex and understanding these nuanced behaviors is important across the social sciences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.
