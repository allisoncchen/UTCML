Yet, while the plot constitutes a core element of narrativity, it has received less attention vis‐à‐vis other narrative components. Existing classifications of plots have been proven to possess a great ability to capture ""universal"" policy stories, but not the specific variations of different types of policies. This article presents a typology of plots by linking their universal and policy‐specific themes, thereby theorizing from Lowi's seminal typology of regulatory, distributive, and redistributive policies. Empirically, it focuses on the political communication of Germany's policy responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Policy narratives were mined from Twitter and from governmental press conferences (March–June 2020). The qualitative NPF analysis demonstrates that the identified plots—restricting‐to‐control, liberating‐to‐promote, providing‐to‐promote, giving‐to‐give, and giving‐to‐promote—can grasp different regulatory, distributive, and redistributive policies as well as their variety.

This study explores six countries (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and Sweden) by employing social network analysis for Twitter. First, this study finds that European countries show different characteristics for social networks with regard to COVID-19. For example, the UK has only national key players, France shows a majority of national key players, and other countries have all global key players. Donald Trump played an important role in the social networks of Italy, Germany and Sweden while he was the US president. Second, European countries demonstrate different social networks for groups. For example, the UK shows the most active communications across groups, whereas Germany shows the least communication networks across groups. Lastly, European countries reveal highly different interests regarding COVID-19. For example, the UK is more interested in the epidemic and vaccines, Germany focuses on schools and studies, and Sweden cares more about herd immunity and lockdown.

This study used classic (Glaserian) grounded theory methodology to explore the experiences and concerns of mental health professionals on social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The main concern that emerged out of research interviews with 26 mental health professionals was a loss of control over others' perceptions and the loss of ability to compartmentalize the different parts of identities associated with personal and professional selves. Participants resolved these concerns through the author-identified basic social process of ""managing digital identities.""

Background: Beginning in March 2020, public health orders across Canada restricted visitors to long‐term care facilities to curb the spread of the infection. This included family caregivers who provide significant support to residents to meet their physical, psychological, social, and safety needs. Method: We collected data from publicly available news and social media. News articles, blogs, and tweets from Canada were collected from March 2020 to April 2021. In total, 40 news articles, eight blogs, and 23 tweets were analyzed using generic qualitative description. Results: Reports from family members indicate that some residents may have died from malnutrition, dehydration, and isolation, rather than from COVID‐19, because of the sudden and prolonged absence of family caregivers. There are long‐term impacts on family suffering and long‐term care worker burnout. Policy and structural issues were identified. Conclusion: Experiences in long‐term care reflected not only impacts of pandemic‐related visitor restrictions, but also long‐standing funding and workforce issues. Implications: Involvement of family, and specifically family caregivers, is crucial in policy decisions, even in unusual circumstances, such as the pandemic.

In this context, then, #MeToo took an understandably collective turn, translating the hashtag from an individually voiced ""Me Too"" centering on the experience of victimization to a collective ""I Too Accuse"", echoing this tradition of speak-outs. This other approach actually offers the benefits of more expansive and certainly a less blindered view of feminist activism and the #MeToo movement. The feverish mobilization around the Twitter hashtag #MeToo occurred relatively recently, in 2017, but events since then provoke a distanced vantage point from which to view the movement anew.

A prominent and strategic use of Twitter was credited to Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, portrayed as a visionary leader supporting economic development, social empowerment and good governance. Within this narrative, women’s empowerment debates underwent multiple transformations. Through this article, we aim to establish the nature of discussions lying at the intersections of feminist thinking and internet technology. We study the discursive trajectory of women’s empowerment against the backdrop of a right-wing political (Hindutva) ideology playing out on Twitter. Utilising the qualitative methods of Thematic Analysis and Feminist Relational Discourse Analysis, we study two cases highlighting feminist campaigns beginning in 2014: instant triple talaq, and the Sabarimala verdict. We analyse tweets in relation to these incidents and highlight the rhetorical inconsistency of right-wing leaders and supporters.

Das leadership beider Bewegungen ist mit jeweils einem Dutzend Personen relativ klein. Zur Erforschung des leadership von sozialen Bewegungen bieten sich insbesondere Methoden der Biographieforschung an. In ethnologischen Forschungsarbeiten wird die Biographieforschung meist mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden wie der Teilnehmenden Beobachtung kombiniert. Zentral für die Ethnologie sind weiterhin ein Perspektivwechsel und die lange Feldforschung. Dabei erheben Ethnolog*innen sehr unterschiedliche biographische Daten und verknüpfen diese miteinander. Für den vorliegenden Artikel erhoben Jan Budniok und Andrea mit den Biographien der Mitglieder des leadership auch ihre Familiengeschichten, um mehr über Darstellung historisch gewachsener Netzwerke zu erfahren. Zudem hängen die individuellen Beweggründe aktiv zu werden in den hier untersuchten Fällen oft mit der eigenen Familiengeschichte zusammen oder werden in einem solchen Zusammenhang dargestellt, um das eigene Handeln zu legitimieren. Diese Kombination von Biographieforschung mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden ist eine Stärke des ethnographischen Ansatzes und kann auch von anderen Disziplinen in der Erforschung sozialer Bewegungen fruchtbar gemacht werden. In 2014, due to an economic crisis, several new protest groups evolved in Ghana. The most prominent amongst them were Occupy Ghana and the Citizen Ghana Movement. Comprising of just a dozen people, the leadership groups of both these movements were relatively small. One of the best methods of researching the leadership of social movements is biographical research. Anthropologists usually combine biographical research with other ethnographic methods, most prominently participant observation. Crucial in anthropological research is a change in the research perspective as well as the long duration of field research. Anthropologists thus collect very different types of biographical data that they then connect to each other. Thus, for the article Jan Budniok and Andrea Noll collect not only the biographies of the interview partners themselves but also their family histories in order to learn more about how historically developed networks are represented. What is more, the reasons for becoming active in a leadership role are often linked to the individual's family history. Or rather, activists make use of their family histories to legitimize their activism. This combination of biographical research with other ethnographic methods is one of the strengths of the ethnographic approach, and one which other disciplines researching social movements may well take advantage of.

We conceptualize collective feminist identity by drawing upon literature on identity, feminism, and social movements. We expected to find a politically-defined group boundary around supporters of ""Day Without A Woman."" Using the online tool Netlytic, we collected tweets posted from accounts in Washington D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles. In a preliminary step, we performed a word count analysis and coded frequent words within the collected tweets into categories of meaning. Based on these categories, we drew a subsample of tweets, which we scrutinized in-depth using discourse analysis. Through this qualitative analysis, we show that the group boundary of the supporters of ""Day Without A Woman"" is defined by the common denominator of their negative relation to Donald TRUMP. While the supporters stress the relevance of feminist claims, barriers to identifying as a feminist seem to persist, as reflected in those whom we call ""flexi-feminists."" The boundary between supporters and nonsupporters of ""Day Without A Woman"" hence seems to broaden from a line to a space which can be occupied without complete group entry. In this space and beyond, supporters express feminist identity through an ""us"" versus ""him"" logic.

We address these questions by studying how protesters appropriate spaces by occupying streets and public buildings and by spreading specific atmospheres. We apply Alfred SCHÜTZ's phenomenological take on the constitution of multiple realities in terms of ""province of meaning"" as a heuristic device to capture the diversity of protest atmospheres along with their spatial, affective, and epistemic dimensions—those embodied and situated as well as virtual. This perspective allows us to describe empirical examples of protest situations in South Africa and Senegal where ""the streets"" and the media meet. Our research material spans documents, tweets, video material collected online, and ethnographic interviews. In this article, we look at how embodied practices reproduce and manifest particular ""provinces of meaning"" and ""protest atmospheres,"" and how these embodied practices are complemented by social media practices. Our proposed approach not only provides an example of how a social space is created and refigured through social protest, but also allows a further understanding of the situational emergence of protests as collective action that creates ""we-experiences."" The phenomenological perspective goes beyond the widespread mind/body dualism that underlies so many interpretations of social movement culture.

In this context, the social network and microblogging platform Twitter is one of the most widely used data sources. In particular, geospatial analyses of Twitter data are proving to be fruitful for examining regional differences in user behavior and attitudes. However, ready-to-use spatial information in the form of GPS coordinates is only available for a tiny fraction of Twitter data, limiting research potential and making it difficult to link with data from other sources (e.g., official statistics and survey data) for regional analyses. We address this problem by using the free text locations provided by Twitter users in their profiles to determine the corresponding real-world locations. Since users can enter any text as a profile location, automated identification of geographic locations based on this information is highly complicated. With our method, we are able to assign over a quarter of the more than 866 million German tweets collected to real locations in Germany. This represents a vast improvement over the 0.18% of tweets in our corpus to which Twitter assigns geographic coordinates. Based on the geocoding results, we are not only able to determine a corresponding place for users with valid profile locations, but also the administrative level to which the place belongs. Enriching Twitter data with this information ensures that they can be directly linked to external data sources at different levels of aggregation. We show possible use cases for the fine-grained spatial data generated by our method and how it can be used to answer previously inaccessible research questions in the social sciences. We also provide a companion R package, nutscoder, to facilitate reuse of the geocoding method in this paper.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Twitter; WORLD; geocoding; GEOLOCATION; LOCATION; official statistics; regional analysis; spatial linkage,WOS,,,,,,,,

The Case of the European COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter,FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY,10.3389/fsoc.2022.884640,,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a critical phase for the transnationalization of public spheres. Against this backdrop, we ask how transnational COVID-19 related online discourse has been throughout the EU over the first year of the pandemic. Which events triggered higher transnational coherence or national structuration of this specific issue public on Twitter? In order to study these questions, we rely on Twitter data obtained from the TBCOV database, i.e., a dataset for multilingual, geolocated COVID-19 related Twitter communication. We selected corpora for the 27 member states of the EU plus the United Kingdom. We defined three research periods representing different phases of the pandemic, namely April (1st wave), August (interim) and December 2020 (2nd wave) resulting in a set of 51,893,966 unique tweets for comparative analysis. In order to measure the level and temporal variation of transnational discursive linkages, we conducted a spatiotemporal network analysis of so-called Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). HINs allow for the integration of multiple, heterogeneous network entities (hashtags, retweets, @-mentions, URLs and named entities) to better represent the complex discursive structures reflected in social media communication. Therefrom, we obtained an aggregate measure of transnational linkages on a daily base by relating these linkages back to their geolocated authors. We find that the share of transnational discursive linkages increased over the course of the pandemic, indicating effects of adaptation and learning. However, stringent political measures of crisis management at the domestic level (such as lockdown decisions) caused stronger national structuration of COVID-19 related Twitter discourse.",MEDIA; Twitter; COVID-19; PATTERNS; discourse analysis; POWER; SITES; DISEASE; dynamic networks; European public sphere; heterogeneous information networks; transnationalization,WOS,,,,,,,,

Our findings suggest that although health officers and female leaders generated more contents on Twitter, political leaders and male authorities were more active in building networks. Offensive language was used more frequently toward males than females and toward political leaders than health leaders. The public also used more appreciation keywords toward health leaders than politicians, while more judgmental and economy-related keywords were used toward politicians.

We also present changes in humor use in relation to the publication of a political survey in which politicians who were part of this study were evaluated. Results showed politicians' use of humor is relatively low in frequency and primarily aggressive. Politicians who are male, younger, and in the opposition tend to use more aggressive humor.

We apply Structural Topic Modeling, an automated text analysis method, to a Twitter dataset (N = 4,376), to understand public responses to the Lorry Deaths incident. We find that Twitter users' posts were organized into two themes regarding attitudes toward immigrants: (1) migration narratives, stereotypes, and victim identities, and (2) border control. Within each theme, both pro- and anti-immigration attitudes were expressed. Pro-immigration posts reflected counter-narratives that challenged the mainstream media's coverage of the incident and critiqued the militarization of borders and the criminalization of immigration. Anti-immigration posts ranged from reproducing stereotypes about Vietnamese immigrants to explicitly blaming the victims themselves or their families for the deaths. This study demonstrates the uses and limitations of using Twitter for public opinion research by offering a nuanced analysis of how pro-and anti-immigration attitudes are discussed in response to a tragic event.

Employing a dynamic difference-in-differences design, we also do not find effects of Oxfam-led training workshops on different aspects of animators' tweeting behavior. While most animators have stopped using Twitter in the long run, a few have continued to use social media to raise local issues and to be part of conversations to this day.

The goal is both show mobilization processes rising from the web and detect main actors, themes, and contents within the European context. Through a mixed method procedure, we tried to identify the main themes and most relevant communities, the main users, the most relevant topics and languages, and the underlined meanings and differences related to languages (as proxies of areas). Monitoring the communication on 3 main topics (""no-mask"", ""covid-19"", ""greenpass""), we noticed the weight of the gap between the government's attempts to communicate information motivating measures geared toward managing the crisis and the perceptions of private users. These perceptions spread through the web with such force the more the emotional, ironic, or polemical plane weighs. In this sense, online communication could be considered a tool for understanding the weight of the interaction between the institutional, social, and private dimensions, with effects on the social construction of identities. Digital communication is becoming an element of this process.

The goal is to characterize the social context behind GNL. Social context analysis of social media data is challenging given that this data type does not contain the social characteristics of its users and the circumstances under which the tweets were written. In order to fill this gap, I will derive the social context information from textual and temporal features by analyzing the names of locations, companies, and people used in the text and relating these entities to the message of the tweet. The analysis of temporal features will give us insights into the correlation between language use and social events. Our results show that the general characterization of the social context behind GNL is associated with socio-economically rich areas in city centers. Users of GNL in the investigated areas address certain groups of people with words that express familiarity and close social relationships, such as those meaning ""friends"" and ""neighbors"" and that give them information about a political, cultural, or social event or concerning commercial products/services. The temporal analysis by month supports this characterization by showing that certain political and social events induce a higher frequency of GNL. This paper contributes to previous research on GNL in Argentina by testing existing hypotheses quantitatively. The new discovery presented here is that political activism is not the only language context in which GNL is used in social media and that GNL is not exclusively used in big cities of Argentina but also in smaller cities.",Twitter; Cordoba; gender neutral language; Greater Buenos Aires; speech act analysis; textual analysis,WOS,,,,,,,,

The popular narrative of political polarization captures tensions that many are noticing and experiencing. However, there is also significant confusion around the concept, as well as gaps between popular perceptions and empirical findings on the different forms of polarization and their prevalence across regions. It is unclear to what extent polarization describes a global phenomenon, as its national and subnational manifestations vary considerably, produced from distinct local histories as well as diffuse transnational forces. While the United States is often treated as ground zero for political polarization, nearby Canada does not appear to be experiencing polarization to nearly the same degree. Using data from a 2019 survey on Atlantic Canadians' political views and perceptions of change, this paper examines whether underlying forms of political polarization are manifesting in the region. We assess whether mass ideological polarization and partisan sorting can be found in Atlantic Canada, looking at socio-cultural and economic dimensions of political values.

By adopting the concept of responsible power approached from a Role Theory perspective, this paper contributes to a more nuanced understanding of interstate relations and role perceptions. Our findings indicate that there have been variations in the responses and perceptions other states have expressed towards China while its framing as a responsible power differs significantly during the crisis and its landmark events.

Social media platforms, such as Twitter, can erode social boundaries and permit persons to challenge social norms and the status quo. Moreover, Twitter may provide a virtual safe space in which women in India can voice their opinions about GBV and press for social change. This article shares findings from research exploring ways in which men and women used Twitter in the aftermath of the Delhi rape case, focusing on the conversations around GBV that took place, and the opportunities that Twitter offers for more strategic engagement of individuals, especially women, to press for social change.

A fundamental belief of the white supremacist 'alt-right' movement is an anti-Semitic narrative that positions Jewish people as a 'global elite' that seeks to oppress and eliminate white populations. Central to this belief is that Jewish people actively manipulate populations of colour, Black people in particular, to overtake white populations in a process known as 'white genocide' or 'the great replacement'. Based on a digital ethnography of altright communities on Voat, Twitter and Reddit, this article demonstrates how the memeified word 'cuck', a pejorative term for 'weak' men on the US political rightwing, draws from and reproduces this white nationalist conspiracy theory through allusions to interracial cuckold pornography. While disguised as innocuous, expressions like 'cuck' provide insight into how the alt-right weaponises misogynist and racist humour in its radicalisation efforts.

This study investigates how gay Nigerians combat homophobia by using language agentively on social media as a semiotic resource towards self-assertion and identity construction. Data retrieved from Twitter via keyword searches suggest that in addition to harnessing agency through positive self-representation and ingroup affirmation, the digital discourses of Nigerian gay men recontextualise religion as a legitimising tool, transforming it into a site of affirmative struggle. These resources reach a crescendo in the practice known as 'kito-ing', a discourse strategy that protects the gay community from threats by publicly 'outing' homophobic actors, thus contesting the prevailing gender hierarchy. While Nigerian physical space restricts queer livability, the digital space becomes a locus for agency whereby various semiotic resources are used to refuse the status quo and assert nonnormative sexualities against an otherwise oppressive social order.

Understanding alt-right mainstreaming is important because the movement has embraced a Gramscian view of politics that believes cultural change (e.g. normalizing unpopular ideas) must precede institutional change (e.g. fielding candidates for office). To conduct my analysis I created a sample of 1,000 tweets from six 'alt-right' leaders. I then asked two questions about the tweets in this sample: what topics did alt-right leaders talk about most frequently, and how did they talk about them. My findings suggest that the 'alt-right's' mainstreaming efforts on Twitter involve a mix of techniques. In terms of race, the alt-right is trying to normalize white identity politics. However, the movement is turning away from blatant misogyny on Twitter, instead strategically mimicking conservative tropes about women needing male protection. Finally, the alt-right references Europe more frequently than the US, suggesting that Europe is a geographic anchor in alt-right discourse.

The white gaze distorts perceptions of people who deviate from whiteness, subjecting them to bodily scrutiny and control. Understanding how the white gaze manifests is therefore important for understanding the marginalization of particular bodies in organizations. We therefore center Black women's narratives to examine the following research question: How is the white gaze enacted and experienced at work? We conducted a critical discourse analysis of 1169 tweets containing the hashtag #BlackWomenAtWork and identified four mechanisms of the white gaze whereby whiteness is imposed, presumed, venerated, and forced on Black women's bodies. We conclude with a discussion of the white gaze as an apparatus to enforce gendered racialized hierarchies vis‐à‐vis the body and how foregrounding whiteness deepens our understanding of marginalization at work.

Greene, Hogan, and Grieco and others suggested that the forms of communication and engagement these technologies offered to unions and their members had the potential to foster gender inclusion and contribute to union diversity, arguably central to effective representation. This article reports on a survey of union members’ experiences with and perceptions of their union's SM services, to identify whether there is a gendered dimension to members’ use. The findings indicate that for most union members regardless of gender, more traditional communication channels such as face‐to‐face contact and email remain the preferred means of communication. However, the findings also show that women are just as likely as men, if not more so, to engage with union SM. Given that historically, women largely participated less in union activities than their male counterparts, this broad parity of use by women supports the conclusion that SM has substantial potential to improve women's participation in unions.

Such is the power of images of the child they can and have shaped the history of nation states, shifted policy and become emblematic of a cry for change. In journalism, filmmaking, and news media the child can become the symbol of a nation, a conflict, a tragedy and the failure of policy, or indeed the adult world, to care and protect childhood itself. Using evocative images from across the 20th and 21st century, this paper interrogates how idealised notions of childhood become focal and challenged by images which reveal the death, deprivation and destruction of children. The image of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi's body on a Turkish Beach in 2015 resonated around the world. It became the biggest trending photo on Twitter within 24 h and graced the front of hundreds of global newspapers the following day. It also demanded a political response, as presidents and prime ministers scrambled to hold press conferences and generate policy to respond to the Syrian and wider so-called Mediterranean crisis. This is just a recent example in a long line of iconic images of 'the child' that have shaped policy and shifted hearts and minds. The power and influence of these photographs is traced here to highlight where the discursive vulnerability of a single child becomes emblematic of the failures of the powerful: adults, governments, nation states, and global governance. Using the examples of famine stricken South Sudan (1993) and the 'migrant crisis' of the Mediterranean Sea (2015), how these hitherto anonymous children briefly become everybody's child is explored here.",media; images; photographs; childhood; social construction,WOS,,,,,,,,

It argues that because of geographical and social mobility experiences, families have not remained static, and consequently, the further they go from the village the more modernized they become. In recent times, African societies as well as family histories have been concerned with connecting with those who have been left behind. As a result, the blueprint that marks out the African family today is found in its mobility both within and out of the continent. At the same time, what glues the family together is the newer forms of technologies encapsulated in Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), which include amongst many others the cell phone, internet, WhatsApp, and Twitter. Letters pre-dated these new technologies and were significantly used by migrant families to stay ""in touch"". Families began in the village, and as newer technologies were introduced-motor cars, a postal service and motorable roads-they moved or thought about places further away. With later technological developments, such as air travel and the mobile phone, families found themselves in distant diasporic spaces. This paper therefore hopes to make a contribution that relates family history and the history of migration to technology and social change. It also has the great value of discussing an area that gets too little attention in historiography. Fundamentally, the paper attempts to compare and contrast the use of technology, the news that could be shared (welfare, births, or obituaries), the length between contacts, the ability to make visits in person, the tensions that cropped up between family members abroad and those back at home in two periods, the 1930s-1940s and the 1990s to the present. What did these periods have in common? What was different and why? For the purpose of clarity, I will start the paper with a short introduction about the area, the issues of family formation, and kfaang. The second part of the paper will focus on the discussion of the ""newness"" of those who migrated to more modern places and the role of technology. The third part compares/contrasts the connections of families in the two periods (1930s-1940s and 1990s-present) in order to flesh out the argument.",communication technology; modernity; family; Cameroon; kfaang; Kom,WOS,,,,,,,,

Second, there is significant spatial autocorrelation for the number of tweets related to the winter storm. The lag coefficient values of the spatial lag model and the spatial error model are 0.362 and 0.437 at a 0.01 significance level, respectively. Third, younger people and people who have less than a high school degree show a positive coefficient value, whereas males, people with a high school degree, and those who have high income show a negative coefficient value for the number of tweets.

While a number of studies have explored users’ demographics and motivations for contribution to explicitly geographic forms of VGI, such as OpenStreetMap and Wikimapia, few have focused on these aspects with implicitly geographic forms of VGI, such as LBSM (for example, Twitter and Instagram). This study, through use of an online survey, specifically assesses the LBSM behavior and perceptions of 253 university students, noting differences found in gender, race, and academic standing. We find that the greatest differences are those between males and females, rather than through race or academic standing, and LBSM appears less biased than other forms of VGI.

Our results indicate that the AfD did indeed face a favorable media environment, especially in the final month of the campaign. Further analysis, however, suggests that the media was in many ways simply responding to public interest and demand-immigration, especially, was a highly salient issue throughout the campaign, something that was a significant departure from recent elections.

While a growing body of research examined hostile ageism during the pandemic, benevolent ageism received less attention. Drawing on the stereotype content theory and the classic tripartite model of attitudes, the current study explored how benevolent and hostile ageism are reflected in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of attitudes toward older adults in German COVID-19-related tweets. The study examined the most prevalent attitudes as well as changes in prevalence between the first and second lockdown period in Germany. Research Design and Methods Seven hundred and ninety-two German tweets concerning COVID-19 and aging were collected and coded using Mayring's qualitative content analysis with a dominantly inductive approach. Quantitative methods were used to identify the most prevalent subthemes as well as changes in prevalence. Results The coding resulted in 21 subthemes. Most tweets (60.73%) contained either hostile or benevolent ageist attitudes, with benevolent ageism being more prevalent. The top 5 subthemes in terms of prevalence and reach contained several opposing attitudes, such as devaluation and opposing devaluation. The chi-square tests revealed a shift from a promotion to an evaluation of COVID-19-related policies between the 2 lockdowns. Discussion and Implications Results highlight social media's polarizing effect and its potential contribution to both hostile and benevolent ageism in the context of COVID-19 in Germany. Results indicate the need to consider the adverse effects of benevolent ageism and use of chronological age as risk factor, when designing COVID-19-related policies.

Most social media analyses in gerontology focus on the content on Twitter and Facebook, with content on TikTok virtually unexplored. Given the burgeoning popularity of TikTok among younger people, we assess the content of TikTok videos with the hashtags #OkBoomer or #Boomer to distill the undercurrents of hostility expressed by younger people toward Baby Boomers. Research Design and Methods We collated TikTok videos (N = 332) with the hashtags #OkBoomer or #Boomer, which received over 5.4 billion views. Both inductive and deductive approaches guided the qualitative content analysis of the videos. Results Five themes emerged. Most videos (79%) described ""Negative Encounters with Baby Boomers"" (Theme 1); 58% were about ""Conflicting Values/Beliefs between Baby Boomers and Younger People"" (Theme 2); 39% were about ""Baby Boomers Antagonizing Younger Generations"" (Theme 3); 22% of the videos made references to the ""Karen Meme"" (Theme 4); and 7% bemoaned the existence of a ""Wealth Gap"" between Baby Boomers and younger people (Theme 5). Discussion and Implications Findings reveal that the usage of the hashtags #OkBoomer and #Boomer is highly nuanced, at times explicitly ageist, and at others, emblematic of a phenomenon far more complex than ageism. There is a need to leverage social media as a space to foster interaction between older and younger people. Society is ultimately well served by intergenerational interaction.
