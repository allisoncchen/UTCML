This study constitutes a wide-ranging investigation that explores how Twitter's platform has been used in the debate regarding whether mixed-gender friendships should be allowed in the Saudi context. Adopting the tools of critical discourse analysis, the study analyses the detailed discourses and discursive strategies pertaining to mixed-gender friendship in a hashtag thread of 8050 tweets collected in September 2020. Overall, the hashtag describes the public reaction and debate with respect to mixed-gender friendship in Saudi Arabia, simultaneously highlighting the contribution of the evoked tweeted arguments in raising awareness of mixed-gender friendship restrictions imposed under the configuration of religious, social, and political discourses. The data analyzed demonstrates that the differences in arguments concerning mixed-gender friendships within the forms of dissent and protest are in a dialogically supportive relation with dominant political, religious, and social conservative discourses.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Twitter; WOMEN; Critical discourse analysis; LEGITIMATION; POLARIZATION; ARABIA; Gender segregation; Hashtag; Mixed-gender; REFORM; Saudi Arabia,WOS,0,,,,,,,

While useful for understanding cross-national differences, they are expensive to collect, include only a limited number of issues and countries, and are not very time sensitive. Many countries across the world now have residents who regularly use Twitter and Google, and these internet platforms are increasingly making data on the country-level number of tweets and google searches available for analysis. While there are a lot of challenges with these data, we examine some of the potential benefits. Specifically, our study assesses the extent to which cross-national social media and survey measures related to religious expression are related. Focusing on Africa, where surveys are particularly difficult to administer, and religious expression, which is quite common across the continent, is high, we find that our religion-related measures derived from google searches correspond particularly well with traditional social science measures. We then look at how all three sets of measures explain terrorism, health-related issues, and the number of Christian and Muslim official holidays within the country. We find that the measures derived from Google almost always perform as well, if not better, than the traditional social science measures. We discuss how internet data may be able to offer reliable and time-sensitive measures for examining differences across nations and for better understanding a range of issues in Africa.",Social media; Research; Africa; ALCOHOL; ATTENTION; Cross-national; HIV; INSIGHTS; Religion; SEARCH; SEXUAL-BEHAVIORS,WOS,5,,,,,,,

Microblogging sites are being used by people across the globe to share their opinions and to express sentiments for everything in real time. Through social listening, companies analyse the sentiments to assess the way forward, and the researchers use it to analyse the trend or an event and give forward-looking recommendations. The objective of the paper is to analyse the sentiments of people relating to Paytm IPO which can be used to predict the way forward. Design/methodology/approach. The study attempts sentiment analysis. For this purpose, QSR NVIVO 12, the qualitative analysis tool was used to retrieve the tweets from the Twitter website. NCapture was installed for this purpose. Post data cleaning, stemming, query augmentation and classification, the Twitter data was analysed. Findings. The sentiments around the IPO of Paytm have been negative and sarcastic. The extremely negative tweets were near twice the number of extremely positive tweets. Practical implication. The study can help an investor in evaluating the investment that they might be planning in the given company. For the company, whose IPO is being considered, an analysis of the sentiments around the IPO can help in taking corrective measures, if the sentiment is negative, towards reputation building. Originality/value. The study is an original contribution to the extant literature in the field of sentiment analysis.

Although the nonstandard form has been labeled in the literature as a calque of Spanish tener que + infinitive 'to have to', it appears in Twitter messages in all of the dialects analyzed. In fact, in our sample there are dialects in which tenir que occurs more frequently than haver de. Grammatical person of the verb used (haver or tenir) is also analyzed as a factor behind the choice of modal periphrasis. Multivariate analysis has been employed, determining that both of these factors (dialect and grammatical person) are statistically significant. The results of the multivariate analysis allow us to apply van Coetsem's (1988) theoretical framework in an attempt to describe the language contact situation in the different dialects. Source-language (sl) agentivity appears to be at work in the dialects where the nonstandard variant is prevalent, while recipient-language (rl) agentivity could be behind the use of the standard variant in the other dialects.

However, in interventions around @EverydaySexism, the article finds collectivising practices more in keeping with an agonistic public discourse based upon involvement and the tactical use of irony and humour. While showing that the platform provides for new forms of antagonistic engagement with political elites, the article therefore offers support for the view that Web 2.0 gives rise to new and shifting formations of non-institutionally-aligned political public.

In moving, conceptually, beyond the idea of identity performance toward one of curation, the paper introduces the idea of didactic text, which serves to contextualize what is seen as good (and bad) farming practice.

In making a general plea for abandoning radical approaches that either consider social media as causative of collective action or fear the spread of ""slacktivism,"" we propose to implement current reflections on transformative effects of social media on collective action dynamics with an explicit focus on the networked structures of participation that derive from the use of these communication tools. Thus we propose to consider these structures as an integral part of what we call collective action socio-technical systems, i.e., a multipolar and multidimensional system of technologically enabled social relations that deploys simultaneously online and offline; and to analyze them empirically through a network approach and techniques paying specific attention to actors, connections between them, contents they produce and patterns of contents circulation.

We also situate the #BLM movement within the surrounding system of racial oppression, including the historical role of racialized policing in maintaining social control of blacks. We detail the long tradition of black social movements, especially black feminist organizing, against systemic racial oppression. In doing so, we intend to contribute social movement theorizing that more fully considers powerful counterframed perspectives of black activists in U.S. social movements.

Our paper reflects on the increased use of social media and empowerment among low-income students (Micheli 2016) and the increasing technological disadvantage that is created when using social media among lowincome and non-traditional students (Greenhow, Walker, and Kim 2009). We examine areas of discomfort among low-income, non-traditional, and minority students, including the lack of technology and internet connectivity in the students' households before college, abuse in social media, creating community and networks, and proper and improper usage of social media. We also argue that teaching of social media use that does not address these areas of discomfort may exacerbate cumulative disadvantages (Diprete and Eirich 2006). We examine how one's background plays a role in creating comfort and discomfort using social media. We provide strategies based on years of experience and past surveys of empowering all students in the classroom by using social media related to our primary teaching areas: race, health, culture, and methods.

We use Poinciana, Florida, a Central Florida Puerto Rican enclave, as a means to examine these constructions. Because of the high concentration of Puerto Rican residents and unprecedented migration to the area, Poinciana is an ideal community to examine media constructions of a migrant group. Utilizing constructivist grounded theory, we analyze all published newspaper articles (1995–2016) and public Twitter posts (2009–2016) about Puerto Ricans in the region (N = 174). We find newspaper articles construct mostly benign views of Puerto Ricans, reflecting ""Happy Talk"" diversity discourse, while Twitter constructions present more negative portrayals, generally relating to population size, and often reflecting a racist ideology reminiscent of the Latino Threat Narrative. We conclude by detailing the significance of divergent constructions across media forms during a period of heightened migration, and how the type of media consumed by Puerto Ricans in this community known as ""Little Puerto Rico"" is likely to influence their perceived level of societal acceptance.

In response, digital spaces emerged as an important gathering space for survivors. While research has addressed the role of social media during disasters, less is known about the long-term uses of digital platforms in post-disaster recovery. This study presents a content analysis of the use of public Facebook groups created by and for survivors of the Camp Fire approximately 1 year after the event. It examines 480 posts from seven groups during a 2-week period from November 19, 2019 through December 2, 2019. Users were most often seeking or providing informational support, but they also frequently used the groups for community-building. Less frequent uses included instrumental, material, and emotional supports. Social media provide an alternative space for these community functions and also enable the recovery of the town itself.",SOCIAL MEDIA; SUPPORT; COMMUNICATION; TWITTER; KATRINA; NEW-ORLEANS; POSTDISASTER RECOVERY; VIRGINIA TECH,WOS,1,,,,,,,

In particular, gleaning demographic information about Twitter users—a key component of much social science research—remains a challenge. This article develops an accurate and reliable data processing approach for social science researchers interested in using Twitter data to examine behaviors and attitudes, as well as the demographic characteristics of the populations expressing or engaging in them. Using information gathered from Twitter users who state an intention to not vote in the 2012 presidential election, we describe and evaluate a method for processing data to retrieve demographic information reported by users that is not encoded as text (e.g., details of images) and evaluate the reliability of these techniques. We end by assessing the challenges of this data collection strategy and discussing how large-scale social media data may benefit demographic researchers.

Both areas of study, however, require accurate counts of indegree, or follower counts; unfortunately, collection of complete time series on follower counts can be limited by application programming interface constraints, system failures, or temporal constraints. In addition, there is almost always a time difference between the point at which follower counts are queried and the time a user posts a tweet. Here, we consider the use of three classes of simple, easily implemented methods for follower imputation: polynomial functions, splines, and generalized linear models. We evaluate the performance of each method via a case study of accounts from 236 health organizations during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. For accurate interpolation and extrapolation, we find that negative binomial regression, modeled separately for each account, using time as an interval variable, accurately recovers missing values while retaining narrow prediction intervals.
