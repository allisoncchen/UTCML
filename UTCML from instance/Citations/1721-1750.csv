Since an increasing amount of political communication now occurs online, data from online interactions may offer a new toolkit to study ties between politicians; however, the methods by which robust insights can be derived from online data require further development, especially around the dynamics of political social networks. We develop a novel method for tracking the evolution of community structures, referred to as 'multiplex community affiliation clustering' (MCAC), and use it to study the online social networks of Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the United Kingdom. Social interaction networks are derived from social media (Twitter) communication over an eventful 17-month period spanning the UK General Election in 2015 and the UK Referendum on membership of the European Union in 2016. We find that the social network structure linking MPs and MEPs evolves over time, with distinct communities forming and re-forming, driven by party affiliations and political events. Without including any information about time in our model, we nevertheless find that the evolving social network structure shows multiple persistent and recurring states of affiliation between politicians, which align with content states derived from topic analysis of tweet text. These findings show that the dominant state of partisan segregation can be challenged by major political events, ideology, and intra-party tension that transcend party affiliations.

We examine a community of Twitter users over a five month period, operationalizing social contagion as 'retweeting', and social structure as the count of subgraphs (small patterns of ties and nodes) between users in the follower/following network. We find that popular individuals act as 'inefficient hubs' for social contagion: they have limited attention, are overloaded with inputs, and therefore display limited responsiveness to viral messages. We argue this contradicts the 'law of the few' and influentials hypothesis'. We find that community structures, particularly reciprocal ties and certain triadic structures, substantially increase social contagion. This contradicts the theory that communities display lower internal contagion because of the inherent redundancy and lack of novelty of messages within a community. Instead, we speculate that the reasons community structures show increased social contagion are, first, that members of communities have higher similarity (reflecting shared interests and characteristics. increasing the relevance of messages), and second, that communities amplify the social bonding effect of retransmitted messages.

When studying cascades, researchers typically assume that the number of active peers when a node adopts is equivalent to the node's threshold for adoption. This assumption is rarely justified due to the ""opacity problem"": networked cascades reveal intervals which contain thresholds, rather than point estimates. Existing approaches take the maximum of each node's threshold interval, which biases models of social influence. Opacity is inevitable in many small graphs when using the threshold model, resulting from the networked process itself rather than data collection techniques. Using simulation, we extend this finding to the probabilistic SI (independent cascade) model. We confirm these theoretical results by studying 50 large hashtag cascades among 3.2 million Twitter users, finding that 20% of adoptions suffer from opacity. Different assumptions in response to opacity qualitatively change conclusions about peer influence. While opacity is a far-reaching problem, it can be addressed. Using information from nodes who have tightly bounded intervals allows building models to reduce error in estimating node thresholds.",DIFFUSION; DYNAMICS; Social influence; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; Measurement; Peer effects; Social contagion; NETWORK,WOS,15,,,,,,,

We investigate the problem of detecting anomalous behaviour by looking at how communication evolves over time in a social network graph. Under the assumption that some nodes of the network could be labelled qualitatively, we present a novel approach that allows us to infer a subset of nodes of the social network which might share the same qualitative connotation. In other words, assuming one or more members belong to some criminal organisation, we wish to investigate how many other persons belong to the same organisation.

However, with the prosperous growth of music streaming services, whether homophily exists in online music listening remains unclear. In this study, two online social networks of the same group of active users who listened to complete songs over 1000 times and posted over 100 tweets are established, separately, in Netease Music and Weibo. Through presented multiple similarity measures, it is evidently demonstrated that homophily does exist in music listening for both online social networks. The unexpected listening similarity in Weibo also implies that knowledge from generic social networks can be confidently transferred to domain-oriented networks for context enrichment and algorithm enhancement. Comprehensive factors that might function in the formation of homophily are further probed, and many interesting patterns are profoundly revealed. It is found that female friends are more homogeneous in music listening and that positive and energetic songs significantly pull users close.

We argue that there also is utility in studying how configurations of four actors, or tetrads, pattern our social world. The current project considers the prevalence of directed tetrads across twenty social networks representing five relationship types (friendship, legislative co-sponsorship, Twitter, advice seeking, and email). By comparing these observed networks to randomly generated conditional networks, we identify tetrads that occur more frequently than expected, or network motifs. In all twenty networks, we find evidence for six tetrad motifs that collectively highlight tendencies toward hierarchy, clustering, and bridging in social interaction. Variations across network genres also emerge, suggesting that unique tetrad structural signatures could define different types of interaction.

However, the underlying process by which celebrity status and media coverage leads to increases in subsequent suicides is still unclear. This study collected over 1 million individual messages (“tweets”) posted on Twitter that were related to 26 prominent figures in Japan who died by suicide between 2010 and 2014 and investigated whether media reports on suicide deaths that generated a greater level of reactions by the public are likely to be followed by a larger increase in actual suicides. We also compared the number of Twitter posts and the number of media reports in newspaper and on television to understand whether the number of messages on Twitter in response to the deaths corresponds to the amount of coverage in the traditional media. Using daily data from Japan's national death registry between 2010 and 2014, our analysis found an increase in actual suicides only when suicide deaths generated a large reaction from Twitter users. In contrast, no discernible increase in suicide counts was observed when the analysis included suicide deaths to which Twitter users did not show much interest, even when these deaths were covered considerably by the traditional media. This study also found suicides by relatively young entertainers generated a large number of posts on Twitter. This sharply contrasts with the relatively smaller volume of reaction to them generated by traditional forms of media, which focuses more on the deaths of non-entertainers. The results of this study strongly suggest that it is not sufficient to examine only traditional news media when investigating the impact of media reports on actual suicides.

However, it remains unclear why, or by what exact mechanism, celebrity suicides act to increase suicidal risk in the wider public due to the lack of data showing how the public understands and reacts to the suicide of well-known figures. This study used a supervised machine learning approach to investigate the emotional content of almost 1 million messages sent on Twitter related to the suicides of 18 prominent individuals in Japan between 2010 and 2014. The results revealed that different demographic characteristics of the deceased person (age, gender, and occupation) resulted in significant differences in emotional response; notably that the suicides of younger people, of women and of people in entertainment careers created more emotional responses (measured as a ratio of emotionally-coded tweets within the overall volume of tweets for each case) than for older people, men, and those in other careers. Moreover, certain types of emotional response were shown to correlate to subsequent rises in the national suicide counts, with ""surprised"" reactions being positively correlated with the suicide counts, while a high proportion of polite messages of condolence were negatively correlated. The study demonstrates the importance of, and describes a methodology for, considering the content of social media messages, not just their volume, in research into the mechanism by which these widely-reported deaths increase suicide risk in the broader public.

A total of 549,972 tweets were downloaded and coded for the presence of anti-vaccine beliefs through a machine learning algorithm. Tweets with self-disclosed geographic information were resolved and United States Census data were collected for corresponding areas at the micropolitan/metropolitan level. Trends in number of anti-vaccine tweets were examined at the national and state levels over time. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used to determine census variables that were correlated with anti-vaccination tweet volume. Fifty percent of our sample of 549,972 tweets collected between 2009 and 2015 contained anti-vaccine beliefs. Anti-vaccine tweet volume increased after vaccine-related news coverage. California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania had anti-vaccination tweet volume that deviated from the national average. Demographic characteristics explained 67% of variance in geographic clustering of anti-vaccine tweets, which were associated with a larger population and higher concentrations of women who recently gave birth, households with high income levels, men aged 40 to 44, and men with minimal college education. Monitoring anti-vaccination beliefs on Twitter can uncover vaccine-related concerns and misconceptions, serve as an indicator of shifts in public opinion, and equip pediatricians to refute anti-vaccine arguments. Real-time interventions are needed to counter anti-vaccination beliefs online.

Guided by the heuristic-systematic model and the health belief model, we found that national health departments differed significantly in the use of systematic-heuristic cues and health belief constructs in COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets. Generally, the provision of scientific information and appeals to anecdotes and fear positively, while appeals to bandwagon negatively, predicted citizen engagement. Messages about overcoming barriers and promoting vaccine benefits and self-efficacy positively affected engagement. Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate demonstrated negative impacts. Importantly, health departments across countries often used futile or detrimental strategies in tweets. A locally adapted evidence-based approach for COVID-19 vaccination persuasion was discussed. • Health departments often used detrimental tactics in promoting COVID-19 vaccines. • Appeals to facts, anecdotes, and fear promoted citizen engagement. • Appeals to bandwagon reduced citizen engagement. • Messages about efficacies and benefits promoted citizen engagement. • Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate harmed citizen engagement.

As BLM gained momentum, counter-movements emerged, such as All Lives Matter (ALM), White Lives Matter (WLM), and Blue Lives Matter (BlueLM). Because they undermine support for Black people's safety and culture, exposure to stances against BLM can be a race-related stressor. Although the perception of racial discrimination has been associated with negative health outcomes in Black people, it is not clear whether exposure to negative stances on a race-related social issue is associated with worse health outcomes. We investigated whether living in areas of the United States with a high prevalence of negative stances on BLM is associated with worse health outcomes, such as higher body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of obesity. We scraped geo-coded tweets (N = 51,020) that contained #BLM, #ALM, #WLM, and #BlueLM from 2014 to 2016. We determined the stances of the tweets on BLM using machine learning algorithms and aggregated stances at the metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area (MMSA) levels. Participants' BMI and obesity status were derived from the 2017 BRFSS SMART data in 76 MMSAs, as compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (N = 20,530). After controlling for individual- and regional-level covariates, regional measures of racism and police brutality rate, and baseline BMI in 2014 aggregated on MMSA level, Black people had a higher BMI and prevalence of obesity in areas that showed higher negative stances on BLM. Stances against BLM were positively associated with implicit racism against Black people and can be an acute race-related stressor associated with negative downstream health outcomes. Negative societal sentiments around race-related issues may be detrimental to the health outcomes of minority populations. • Stances on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement captured through Twitter data. • Stances against BLM associated with higher BMI and prevalence of obesity for Blacks. • Stances against BLM associated with higher level of implicit racism against Blacks. • Negative stances on race-related issues can be detrimental to minorities' health.

Using comprehensive six-year data sets of Twitter posts and suicide deaths in Japan, we examine the diurnal relationship between the proportional incidence of a suicide-related keyword, ""kietai"" (""I want to disappear""), and suicide deaths with an OLS regression model. We also use co-occurrence analysis to reveal changes in the linguistic context of the suicide-related keyword at different hours of the day. We find a clear diurnal pattern in the use of this suicide-related keyword, peaking between 1am and 5am. This diurnal trend is positively correlated with suicide deaths among younger cohorts (ages 15 to 44), but the correlation is negative among older adults (45 and over). The correlation among young adults strengthens when a delay between tweet incidence and suicide deaths is included. Compared to daytime tweets, nighttime tweets exhibited a stronger relationship between words related to self-disgust and words directly indicating suicidal intent. This study confirms the hypothesised link between online suicidal ideation and suicide death. Despite frequent flippant use of the keyword, the consistent correlation and the diurnal changes in the context of the keyword's usage demonstrate the value of social media data to the study of mental health trends in groups at risk of suicide. • Uses Twitter data to confirm a link between online suicidal ideation and suicide. • Shows a correlation between suicide deaths and usage of a suicide-related keyword. • A positive correlation is found for suicides by people aged under 45 in Japan. • Allowing a time lag for preparation or travel strengthens the correlation. • Text analysis relates the keyword more closely to ""self-disgust"" at night.

An important contributor to LGBT health disparities is the inequitable or substandard care that LGBT individuals receive from hospitals. Objective To investigate inequities in hospital care among LGBT patients using the popular social media platform Twitter. Method This study examined a dataset of Twitter communications (tweets) collected from February 2015 to May 2017. The tweets mentioned Twitter handles for hospitals (i.e., usernames for hospitals) and LGBT related terms. The topics discussed were explored to develop an LGBT position index referring to whether the hospital appears supportive or not supportive of LGBT rights. Results for each hospital were then compared to the Healthcare Equality Index (HEI), an established index to evaluate equity of hospital care towards LGBT patients. Results In total, 1856 tweets mentioned LGBT terms representing 653 unique hospitals. Of these hospitals, 189 (28.9%) were identified as HEI leaders. Hospitals in the Northeast showed significantly greater support towards LGBT issues compared to hospitals in the Midwest. Hospitals deemed as HEI leaders had higher LGBT position scores compared to non-HEI leaders (p = 0.042), when controlling for hospital size and location. Conclusions This exploratory study describes a novel approach to monitoring LGBT hospital care. While these initial findings should be interpreted cautiously, they can potentially inform practices to improve equity of care and efforts to address health disparities among gender minority groups. Highlights • Our study describes a novel approach for monitoring LGBT hospital care. • Twitter may be feasible for exploring inequities in hospital care in LGBT patients. • Twitter data appear consistent with the annual Healthcare Equality Index report. • Demonstrates potential to understand health disparities using social media. • Can inform efforts to improve equity of care among gender minority groups.

1740,journalArticle,2020.0,"Pavlova, Alina; Berkers, Pauwke",Mental health discourse and social media: Which mechanisms of cultural power drive discourse on Twitter.,Social Science & Medicine,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=146428625&site=ehost-live,"The global burden of mental health disorders has increased steadily during the past decade. Today, mental illness is the leading cause of total years lived with disability. At the same time, global mental health policies and budgets fall short of addressing the societal burden as mental health discourse languishes in the shadows due to stigma. As social media have become an increasingly popular source of information, they create opportunities as well as threats for mental health discourse. On the one hand, social media can help to bring awareness to stigmatized topics as they give marginalized members of society the possibility to share experiences and voice their discontent. On the other hand, mental health discourse on social media may lead to stigmatization. To date, little is known about social media mental health discourse and what drives it. This study addresses these research gaps by (1) mapping the mental health discourse on Twitter and (2) analyzing mechanisms of cultural power through which some mental health topics take prevalence over the others. Drawing on Twitter data, this research employs innovative methods of topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and panel data regression analyses. Theoretically, it combines, in a multidisciplinary fashion, concepts such as emotional energy and cognitive focus from sociology and bandwagon behavior from economics. Our findings show that low-cost attention mechanisms are ineffective in fostering online mental health discourse, whereas emotional energy and discursive variability have a positive influence by engaging audiences, creating online solidarity, and speaking to worldviews of audiences from different walks of life. Social media mental health discourse is also shown to be quite diverse and more stigma-neutral than such discourse in traditional media. • Emotional energy (engagement, confidence, and solidarity) drives mental health discourse on Twitter. • Low-cost attention generating mechanisms are ineffective in fostering online mental health discourse. • Online mental health discourse is subject to cognitive-emotional currents and requires content variability. • Discursive diversity drives general mental health discourse, subject-focused tweets drive the retrievability of a topic. • Stigma-related online mental health discourse is driven by sensationalism and positive emotions through the use of sarcasm.

The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political ""Left"" diverge from those on the ""Right""). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions. Analyses use data from two sources: an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing). Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors. Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived ""common ground,"" between the political ""Right"" and ""Left."" Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology. • COVID-19 mitigation behavior willingness varies by political identity. • Risk perceptions moderate the political identity - mitigation willingness link. • Political polarization of mitigation willingness is weakened by high perceived risk. • COVID-19 deaths may better communicate risk than COVID-19 infections.

We examined Twitter posts between January 2020 and September 2021 by Democratic and Republican politicians to determine how they framed the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these posts, we carried out a survey study between September and November 2021 to examine whether motivations for COVID-19 vaccine uptake matched message frames that were widely used by these politicians. Finally, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment to examine how these frames (economic vs. health) affected intentions to vaccinate by vaccine refusers in both parties. Republican politicians were more likely to frame the pandemic in economic terms, whereas Democrats predominantly used health frames. Accordingly, vaccinated Republicans' choices were more likely to be motivated by economic consideration (β = 0.25, p = 0.02) and personal financial rationales (β = 0.24, p = 0.03). Among vaccine refusers, Republicans exposed to messages using economic rationales to encourage vaccination reported higher vaccination intentions compared to those exposed to messages using public health rationales (F 1,119 = 4.16, p = 0.04). Messages highlighting economic and personal financial risks could increase intentions to vaccinate for vaccine-hesitant Republicans. Agencies should invest in developing messages that are congruent with frames that are already widely used by co-partisans. Social media may be helpful in eliciting these frames. • Republican politicians framed COVID-19 in economic terms on Twitter. • Vaccinated Republicans were motivated by economics and personal finance. • Economy-frame health messages increased Republicans' intent to vaccinate.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study posits that temporal focus will affect adherence behavior regarding health control measures, such as social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing, which will be manifested through the degree of spread of COVID-19. It is suggested that social media can provide an indicator of the general temporal focus of the population at a particular time. In this study, we examine the temporal focus of Twitter text data and the number of COVID-19 cases in the US over a 317-day period from the inception of the pandemic, using text analytics to classify the temporal content of 0.76 million tweets. The data is then analyzed using dynamic regression via advanced ARIMA modelling, differencing the data, removing weekly seasonality and creating a stationary time series. The result of the dynamic regression finds that past orientation does indeed have an effect on the growth of COVID-19 cases in the US. However, a present focus tends to reduce the spread of COVID cases. Future focus had no effect in the model. Overall, the research suggests that detecting and managing temporal focus could be an important tool in managing public health during a pandemic. • Examines temporal focus of US social media users and COVID infection rates. • Applies text analytics and dynamic regression via ARIMA on 0.76 million tweets. • Finds that past temporal focus is related to the growth of COVID-19 cases. • Present focus was related to a reduction in the spread of COVID cases. • Temporal focus could be helpful in managing public health during the pandemic.

This research aimed to understand media effects on risk perceptions and behaviors concerning the Zika virus in the United States. Methods We analyzed a multi-wave nationally representative survey ( N  = 29,062) and the volume of communications in social and legacy media (i.e., legacy media data from news sources and databases, N  = 2,660 and social media data from Twitter, N  = 1,605,752) in the United States between April and October 2016, dates coinciding with the early cases of local transmission of Zika in the United States (i.e., 25 weeks). The present study conducted econometric analyses (i.e., Granger causality tests) to assess the associations of legacy and social media coverage with risk perceptions and protective behaviors in the total sample and specific groups separated by pregnancy status/intent, geographic region, income, education level, age, and ethnicity. Results The results from the overall sample suggested that changes in the volume of information in legacy and social media (i.e., Twitter) were followed by different changes in community risk perceptions and protective behaviors. Specifically, social media coverage correlated with the level of risk perceptions, whereas the legacy media coverage correlated with the level of protective behaviors. Analyses across different subpopulations, including those of different pregnancy status/intent, geographic Zika risk, income, education level, age, and ethnicity, replicated the social media associations with risk perceptions in most cases. However, legacy media and protective behaviors were linked only in some vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., the less-educated populations). Conclusion Understanding how media coverage relates to Zika risk perceptions and protective behaviors will help to facilitate effective risk communications by healthcare professionals and providers, particularly when a health risk emerges.

While previous literatures have been 'sanitized' to emphasize the importance of managing optimal physiological health and safety, we would like to argue that keener attention is needed to rethink the constitutive role of bodies in co-producing a city's sociopolitical ecologies at this time of crisis. The main body is divided into three sections. The first section introduces the political dimensions of pandemic response by various governments with an emphasis to experiences of middle to low income countries. Our intention is to show how these studies bring into light the role of local politics of pandemic response within countries, and that actual governance mechanisms in cities are shaped and contested by shifting power blocs and emergent affinities. The second section forwards an embodied urban political approach that conceptualizes bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure. In this view, bodies-in-waiting is produced and reproduced by complex social-material flows and transformation rooted in variegated matrices of power through which urban spaces are (re)assembled. The last section demonstrates a sample case that shows how bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are understood using Twitter-sourced data associated with the Philippine government's disciplinary quarantine measures which started March 12, 2020 in the NCR. At its core, bodies-in-waiting as infrastructures populate a politically affirmative urban imaginary of bodies living on despite the existence of an accelerated and mutating virus in slower moving cities. • A conceptual innovation of bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure. • Bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are assembled in contested moral fields. • Bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are politically affirmative spaces of living on. • Application of concept in understanding disciplinary quarantine measures.
