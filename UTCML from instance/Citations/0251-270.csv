Our findings show that using Twitter on mobile phones is associated with a higher likelihood for both online and offline political participation, as well as online expressive communication. Using Facebook is associated with a higher likelihood for online expressive communication only. The key contribution of this article is to show empirical differences between the relationships of social media and social networking on mobile devices with political participation and online expressive communication. Public social media apps, such as Twitter, bring mobile communication back into the public realm of a (albeit diffused) broadcast-like channel. Mobile Twitter adds to the affordances of mobility, networked connectivity, and the publicness of social media.",,SAGE,15,,,,,,,

Through an analysis of social media posts and activists’ documents, I identify the functions that these platforms perform for the movement. My findings show a very limited importance of content that expresses the identity of the movement, spreads alternative news, and criticizes mainstream media, while the preponderance of protest reporting suggests that activists use social networking sites mainly to communicate “what they do,” rather than “who they are.” I argue that the lack of identity-content is the result of the incompatibility between the decentralized political processes of Occupy and the individual-centric nature of social networking sites. I also suggest we need to rethink the relationship between social movements’ identities and media strategies in light of a changed media environment.",,SAGE,13,,,,,,,

In Study 1, we examined rank correlations between the media agendas on COVID-19 and public agendas. The results indicated that Twitter agendas resonate with those who have liberal tendencies. In Study 2, we used data from the Internet survey to identify the political attitudes of agenda-builders who tweet or retweet on COVID-19. The results of the model analyses indicated that people with liberal tendencies, motivated by their political attitude, created original tweets, and some of those tweets were then retweeted by flaming-oriented people driven by a sense of justice.

Despite these critiques, the use of alternative sources for news data has been limited to mixed-methods of interviewing or surveying participants. However, the use of alternative media sources that place newspapers on the same level as other possible reporters of social movement activity is available. Social media, such as Twitter, contains accounts from traditional news sources such as newspapers and television stations, in addition to accounts from social movement entities themselves. Thus, through placing the various aforementioned groups' Twitter accounts under analysis to examine the tweets that each group posts in relation to social movement activities, the biases of each respective organization are checked. As such, this study conducted an analysis on a local Black Lives Matter (BLM) chapter in Norfolk, Virginia and analyzed 30 twitter accounts from various originations in Norfolk from the years of 2013 to 2018 to monitor the references of BLM's related activity in the city. My findings demonstrate that there is a difference in how BLM events are covered by organizations. Moreover, through the use of multiple accounts from a variety of different participants, the biases in reporting information on the social movement that each organization might have are counteracted by the other accounts that are analyzed. Future applications for this work include using it with other methods for analyzing movements such as interviews and surveys or to provide an alternative to newspaper analysis.

Social media data allow social psychologists to capture the process of manufacturing and sustaining collective identities and collective action in social movements as they capture a growing segment of the U.S. population. Recent events related to police brutality and the evolution of #BlackLivesMatter provides an empirical case by which to explore the vitality of social media data. Following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, #BlackLivesMatter exploded into the social media sphere. As evidence by protests and unrest in Ferguson, MO and Baltimore, MD, the hashtag social movement to curtail racial profiling and police brutality is still progressing three years later. Social scientists, public health scholars, and activists have documented the severity of police brutality, particularly for Blacks and Latinos. Missing, however, is a social psychological analysis that simultaneously combines the utility of sociological and humanist methodologies grounded in content analysis and quantitative analysis. This article takes up this challenge by analyzing data from a Twitter archive of tweets related to Ferguson. Drawing upon literatures on collective identities, collective action, and which links to social movements and collectivist action, we analyze 31.65 million tweets about Ferguson across four meaningful time periods: the death of Michael Brown, the non-indictment of police officer Darren Wilson, the Department of Justice report on Ferguson, and the one year aftermath of Brown's death. Our analysis of the most popular Twitter hashtags, tweeted images, and narratives show that social media activism is linked to boots on the ground, conflates with mainstream news coverage, and primarily comes from identified leading activists of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. We also show that a concerted counter narrative hashtagged #TCOT (Top Conservatives on Twitter) has operated as the primary anti-thesis to #BlackLivesMatter tweets. In doing so, we demonstrate the vitality of social media and establish a methodological agenda for scholars aiming to conduct rigorous, cutting edge, contextual, and timely research with social media data to focus on a host of outcomes including identity formation, race relations, protests, and politics.

Gender, a social construct, is dependent on its performativity, and this continues to evolve as our media does. This study begins to examine the ways in which gender may be conveyed using social media, by observing the role of gender and use of gender identifiers in over 6 million Twitter bios, using digital trace data. Using this large database of both cross-sectional and longitudinally collected Twitter biographies, we investigate gender differences in the use of gender identifiers, in both individual (male/female, man/woman, boy/girl, etc.) and relational (husband/wife, father/mother, dad/mom, etc.) contexts. The results of these analyses revealed significant differences between men and women in both the types and frequencies of the gender identifiers used, with men being significantly more likely to use almost all types of gendered identifiers. These results may highlight important differences in how men and women related to gendered identities and roles. It may also highlight the ways in which masculinity or maleness is asserted in social media. The significance and implications of these results are discussed below.

Yet little is understood concerning their impacts in the lives of individuals. Since nonprofits are often explicitly oriented toward building and helping communities, they should be associated with increased wellbeing on the part of citizens. This study explores whether communities with higher numbers of nonprofits per capita exhibit greater social well-being in the form of more positive relationships, emotions, and engagement and fewer negative relationships, negative emotions, and disengagement. We use novel measures of social well-being -- positive and negative tweets in a county -- and relate them to per capita nonprofits in relevant fields, such as the arts, derived from the National Center for Charitable Statistics. We find that most categories of nonprofit organizations (e.g., education, recreation/sports, and human services) decrease the expression of negative emotions, negative sentiments about relationships, and disengagement on Twitter. A few categories of nonprofits, those focused on the arts, education, philanthropy, and the environment, also increase the proportion of tweets in a county that indicate engagement and positive emotions. This study broadens the discussion regarding what nonprofits may be accomplishing in the communities in which they are located.

Migration scholars have theorized that punitive measures like SB 1070 not only reflect the hardening of public opinion about immigration, but could also negatively affect people's sentiments towards immigrants. However, such contention has not been assessed systematically. Using sentiment analysis and a difference-in-difference estimation technique to analyze more than 250,000 tweets published in Arizona and Nevada in 2010, I find that the implementation of SB 1070 had a significant negative impact on the sentiment of messages regarding immigrants posted by Twitter users in Arizona. Further, though the bill's supporters argued that the law only targeted unauthorized immigrants, I find that the law also negatively shaped public sentiment towards Mexicans and, more generally, towards Hispanics. In contrast, the bill did not affect public discourse on Asian immigrants or African-Americans. However, these changes in public discourse were not caused by changing attitudes toward immigrants but by mobilizing users who were already critical of immigrants and motivating a new group of users to begin posting messages about immigrants.

Activists campaigning against the deportation of undocumented migrants in the United States introduced the #not1more hashtag in early 2013, which is analyzed as an example of ""open source activism"", and compared to the #blacklivesmatter movement. The campaign has a distinct topology: there are persistent and well-connected core users and many ephemeral users. The campaign also has a distinct geography: it has four interconnected metropolitan hubs and a large periphery in cities where activism flares up episodically. This topology and geography is explained by analyzing how network communities are constituted. While the exact topology and geography of #not1more and #blacklivesmatter is distinctive, we expect qualitatively similar patterns in other cases of open source activism.

This paper offers a theoretical and empirical exploration of a less-frequently discussed form of solidarity between two diverse campaigns; one based less on shared identity and more on shared values; one that is aimed less at persistence and more at short-term impact. Building upon earlier conceptual work (Wright et al. 2018), we call this form drive-by solidarity because of its one-way, unsolicited, hit-and-run nature. This paper examines drive-by solidarity through case of Anonymous' ""Operation KKK"" (#OpKKK), an online hacktivist campaign against the Ku Klux Klan carried out in response to threats of violence they made against #BlackLivesMatter protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in November 2014. After constructing a timeline of events from available news stories and videos for context, we use over three million tweets to conduct a series of network analyses to model the most significant online accounts associated with each campaign as well as the connections built across the respective online discursive spheres through retweets and mentions. We graph both the period of the 2014 #OpKKK campaign, along with its revival one year later, in order to empirically examine the short- and long-term effects. Although Anonymous acted unilaterally and made no efforts to be inclusive of #BlackLivesMatter activists in their deliberations, the campaigns became politically coordinated. #OpKKK successfully achieved its initial goals; however, longer-term effects were more volatile. This form of solidarity is theoretically compelling because it seems to challenge much extant theory on the role of identity in building solidarities, and even forces us to rethink social movement success. Furthermore, we propose that drive-by solidarity could offer a possible model for other movements seeking high-impact, low cost, short-term campaigns.

Ideal points are central to the study of political partisanship and an essential part of our understanding of the behavior of elected officials. However, current research is limited by the fact that ideal points are based on legislative voting records which can only calculated at the end of a legislative session and cannot be used to compare officials across legislative sessions, branches of government, or levels of government. In this paper, we show how to use nave Bayes and Support Vector Machine classification to calculate ideal points for Members of Congress and estimate the partisanship of individual words and tweets. We validate these estimates by comparing them against existing ideal point measures. We argue that this approach to measuring partisanship has three key advantages. First, it is more consistent with behavioral theories of partisanship as compared with existing measures. Second, it offers a higher quality measure of partisanship which accurately measures partisanship with relatively few data points. Finally, it enables a wide variety of people, organizations, and institutions to be measured and compared politically.

Although cyberaggression on Twitter has begun to receive attention, little research has systematically explored the common themes found in hostile messages on this social media platform. Understanding the thematic content of cyberaggression is of particular interest since there may be differences in the content based on the characteristics of the victims. Furthermore, the topics that are used to attack individuals are important to study because they may be unique to certain groups. In this project, we focus on cyber aggression directed towards women of color. We apply topic analysis and social network methodology to the issue of cyberbullying, or cyber aggression, on the social media platform Twitter. In this research, we begin by examining the occurrence of aggressive, harmful Twitter messages that are directed towards several groups of women of color in the United States, including Hispanic/Latinx women and Black women. Next, we discuss common themes that emerge within these types of communications. In our sample of tweets that targeted blacks, our findings suggest one common theme concerned promiscuity, suggesting that black women are more sexual. In messages containing Latinx slurs, on the other hand, the current political climate in the United States was a recurring theme in aggressive messages. This project illustrates the role that stereotyping and context play in aggressive content on Twitter. Our findings reveal that social norms that enforce traditional, negative race and gender stereotypes, are evident in aggressive messages.

We argue that the various stages of a protest cycle moderate the relationship between the innovativeness of content related to a movement and the rate of diffusion of the movement. To test our propositions, we adopt methods from natural language processing to conduct a computational analysis of content related to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter from May 2016 to July 2016. Our findings show that tweets with less differentiated content are more likely to spread during the initial stage of a protest cycle - which we call the ripening stage - but when the movement gains momentum - entering what we call the frenzy stage - tweets with more differentiated content are more likely to spread.
