Media effects research has documented the ability of vox pops to influence consumer perceptions of news issues within the traditional media environment, but there is limited research on the possible effects that including social media exemplars as vox pops within editorially curated articles might have on issue perceptions. Drawing on the exemplification effects literature to inform the experimental design, we conduct two studies on two topics of either low or high national salience and find strong evidence that vox pop tweets can influence perceptions of public opinion and, indirectly, readers' own opinions on an issue. Results are discussed in light of implications for journalistic practice, media effects research and the wider democratic process.

By creating broader visibility and wider reach of racist texts and facilitating more participation for racists, social media platforms such as Twitter normalize gendered and place-based racialization of refugees. Recently, hostility and hate became the norm in derogating the refugee identity on social media platforms. To investigate the complexity of digital racism, this article presents a unique case study on Twitter, capturing the widespread user reactions in the aftermath of the mass resettlement of Syrians in Turkey. It examines varying racialization of Syrians on the Turkish Twittersphere, using sentiment and qualitative content analyses of hashtags and mentions on Syrians, when they hit Twitter trends for Turkey for a year, first, for mundane events and, second, during the Turkish state's occupation in Northern Syria.

Concession and victory speeches emerged as a distinct convention in the television era, but as web services like Twitter take on a larger role in electoral politics, traditions like the concession are being adapted to new formats. The literature has identified a series of substantive and procedural conventions for conceding and claiming victory, but it is unclear how these conventions hold up as technology evolves. An examination of 200 Twitter feeds from congressional, senatorial, and gubernatorial candidates during the 2010 midterm elections shows that while candidates touch some of the traditional concession themes, the procedural rules to concession have not migrated unchanged to the online world.

Participants gave examples of how political tweets have shaped their coverage in terms of the events they cover, the sources they interview, the quotes they use, and the background information they rely on to decide how to cover an issue. In addition, political tweets that contribute the most to coverage tend to have several elements in common.

The OWS case study demonstrates how the rapid digital circulation of texts allows protestors to quickly build a geographically dispersed, networked counterpublic that can articulate a critique of power outside of the parameters of mainstream media. Furthermore, we find that the relay of pre-existing material was perceived to be just as meaningful a form of participation as drafting original compositions. By including these forwarding activities in their online efforts, these Twitter users worked to expand the circulation of information building and sustaining an OWS counterpublic. However, dependence on this external platform leaves protestors vulnerable to restrictions on their ability to communicate, as well as to unwanted surveillance from potentially hostile authorities.

Our framework combines journalistic as well as social media logics in Bourdieu’s field framework, for which we combine Twitter data and newsroom inquiry. The network analysis of Twitter activity shows the impact of the conversation manager, although his activities are primarily guided by traditional journalistic values. In turn, the tweeting audience impacts newsroom practices, predominantly as an indicator of audience appreciation.

Through an experimental design conducted on 405 college students, this study probed how the presentation of textually based (Twitter) and visually based (Instagram) messages affected American college students’ recall of digital information. It also investigated how communicator credibility affected the way college students consumed digitally disseminated information. Results showed that information retention was most improved by visually based information published by professional news outlets. Such findings help to better understand the contributions social media are capable of making as information tools, particularly when applied to American post-secondary education.

Specifically, the perceived appropriateness (i.e. injunctive norms) of expressing six discrete emotions (i.e. sadness, anger, disappointment, worry, joy, and pride) was investigated across four different social media platforms. Drawing on data collected in March 2016 among 1201 young Dutch users (15-25 years), we found that positive expressions were generally perceived as more appropriate than negative expressions across all platforms. In line with the objective of the study, some platform differences were found. The expression of negative emotions was rated as most appropriate for WhatsApp, followed by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. For positive emotion expression, perceived appropriateness was highest for WhatsApp, followed by Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Additionally, some gender differences were found, while age showed little variations. Overall, the results contribute to a more informed understanding of emotion expression online.

This widespread populist movement has expanded regardless of whether these political systems were established democracies, emerging democracies, or societies immersed in political contexts at peril. This essay serves as the introductory piece to a special issue on populism. First, it highlights the ways in which ""populism,"" being an old phenomenon, has further transpired into the political realm in the era of social media. Second, the essay seeks to better contextualize what populism is and how it has developed within today's hybrid media society. Finally, this introduction also lays out the ground to six central theoretical and data-driven papers that encapsulate many of the important issues revolving the phenomenon of populism today.

The case explored is a Twitter-based community in South Korea that calls for the elimination of a conservative national daily newspaper and whose activism is contextualized in the political history of Korea. Based on the mixed-method approach, the research results suggest that the role of the group organizer as an information provider and coordinator contributed to the sustainability of the group, and that group members formed a collective identity through the framing process of discourse. In addition, massive “retweeting” and “culture jamming” tactics were found to be strategically employed to enhance group solidarity, to broaden the base of support, and to crystallize involvement into political acts with other offline actions. Rather than decaying to an echo chamber or “slacktivism”, the online community seemed to demonstrate a new form of collective activism through the mediation of technology in everyday life.

Although the Internet was stated as the most important news outlet, state-controlled television was often used, and Twitter was the least prevalent new media platform. Personal issues and IT/science were more often discussed via new media than politics. Further, it was using new media, not talking politics online, that predicted the frequency with which respondents encountered blocked websites online and also perceptions of their ownpolitical efficacy. Although our findings may support voices that are skeptical about technology’s ability to sustain revolution, we also identify what can be described as hubs of politicized Iranian youth.

Analysis of more than 2 million accounts of followers of 10 national party leaders during the Italian 2013 general election campaign shows that most users are rather inactive and have very small followings. Moreover, the most followed politicians have on average the least active and followed users, and vice versa. Users’ activity and followings are also unevenly distributed, with very tiny minorities accounting for the vast majority of tweets and followers. The most followed followers of politicians are celebrities in realms other than politics, or people who are already highly visible in the politics-media ecosystem. Our findings suggest that most of the potential for indirect communication may lie in the “vital middle” of the Twitter population who are more active than average, but are not part of the restricted elite of high-impact outliers.

The analysis of 581 images revealed more efficacy-eliciting (crowds, protest activities, national and religious symbols) than emotionally arousing (violent) content, especially posted by Egyptian users. However, emotionally arousing content decreased, whereas efficacy-eliciting content increased at times of instability. Furthermore, popularity of images was more associated with user information than the content itself. Images posted by activists and users outside Egypt received the most attention. The findings are discussed in terms of possible explanations for the content patterns and their potential impact on Twitter audience, as well as their contributions toward establishing a theory of user-generated content during political movements.

However, in practice it can be difficult to be heard in these crowded digital spaces. This study takes a strategic network perspective and draws from recent research in network science to propose the network contingency model of public attention. This model argues that in the networked social-mediated environment, an organization's ability to attract public attention on social media is contingent on its ability to fit its network position with the network structure of the communication context. To test the model, we combine data mining, social network analysis, and machine-learning techniques to analyze a large-scale Twitter discussion network. The results of our analysis of Twitter discussion around the refugee crisis in 2016 suggest that in high core-periphery network contexts, ""star"" positions were most influential whereas in low core-periphery network contexts, a ""community"" strategy is crucial to attracting public attention.

The studied populist messages reflect ideational definitions of populism. Thus, populist messages appeal to the people, dismiss the elites as appalling, or highlight the people's right to unfettered rule. Despite German-speaking countries offering a variety of populist parties, existing automated approaches are rarely applicable to German texts. Furthermore, they are not tailored to social media and often focus only on anti-elitism. I vastly improved existing dictionaries by analyzing populist ideology in its entirety, including people-centrism and the demand for people's sovereignty. The article showed how known populist parties in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland spread these messages to a great extent on social media. Furthermore, I was able to highlight intra-party differences. Finally, the article discusses different aspects of validity and shows that the proposed approach offers high convergent validity and split-half reliability.

This shift is occasioned by broader cultural transformations since the 1990s as well as developments on social media since the late 2000s.

To identify the relationship between emotions expressed and solidarity, marked by sustained participation in the crowd, the study uses tweets from a unique population of crowds-those tweeting about ongoing National Football League games. Observing this population permits the use of game results as quasi-random treatments on crowds, helping to reduce confounding factors. Results indicate that participation in these crowds is self-sustaining in the medium term (1 week) and can be stimulated or suppressed by emotional expression in a short term (1 hour), depending on the discrete emotion expressed. In particular, anger encourages participation while sadness discourages it. Positive emotions and anxiety have a more nuanced relationship with participation.

Based on interviews and participant observation of a peace movement in Ambon, Indonesia, this research found that the peace movement actors use Facebook, Twitter, Path, WhatsApp, SMS, and mobile phones for maintaining existing relationships, reanimating memories, keeping up with current movements, amplifying ongoing movements, and sharing new grievances. The platforms provide the actors with opportunities to sustain their existing networks. Hence, the movement persists and influences later movements.

We analyzed 10 cultural projects hosted on the Dutch crowdfunding platform “Voordekunst.” Our results contribute to theorizing on latent tie activation by demonstrating that social media messages and platform updates add economic value to the crowdfunding effort.

Candidates who personalized elicited higher evaluations of social presence and parasocial interaction. For female candidates who shared a supported party with a respondent, personalization leads to feelings of perceived presence and parasocial interaction. Ultimately, the feelings of intimacy created by personalized tweets led respondents to express support for personalizing candidates, but this effect is contingent upon the gender and in-party status of the candidate.

We examine the relationship between the use of SNSs and involvement in discussions with politically similar and dissimilar others among a sample of US Democrats and Republicans. Affective polarization is negatively related to involvement in cross-cutting discussions, suggesting that individuals extend their dislike of the opposing political party to out-party members within their online social networks. Moreover, political discussion with one’s friends on SNSs plays a mediating role in involvement in both cross-cutting and like-minded discussions. Finally, party identification moderates the relationship between SNS use and involvement in cross-cutting discussions, indicating that Republicans participate more frequently than Democrats in cross-cutting exchanges on SNSs. In the light of these findings, we discuss the contribution of SNSs to the ideals of deliberative democracy.

The introduction of photography “apps,” like Hipstamatic or Instagram, adds layers of aesthetic capabilities not previously available within the camera. These capabilities have attracted artists seeking technologies for new media of artistic expression. Drawing on Becker’s theory of “art worlds,” this article describes the ways in which iPhone photographers, or iphoneographers, engage in the process of art world building. Through online ethnography and semistructured interviews, this study reveals the ways iphoneographers are creating, sharing, and critiquing their work. The practices of iphoneographers are not unlike those of artists engaged with new media throughout history, and indicate patterns of remediation. Through their activities, the iphoneography community is grappling with issues about the values, practices, aesthetics, and even aura of iphoneography, and in doing so, they are building and legitimating a new art world.

In the last couple of years, they have begun to interact with radio in theatres, cinemas and assorted make-shift gig venues, via mobile apps and social media platforms, and in the form of live performances, online videos, maps, tweets, blogs, forums, essays, photographs and interactive websites. Radio, like every other medium, is experimenting with ever more complex cross-media practices. These kinds of activities have been analysed at length with regard to commercial film, television and gaming, but much less is understood about radio-born approaches to transmedia content. This article considers how existing transmedia theories can contribute to our understanding of these new radio practices and also how radio-originated cross-media productions might challenge some of the ingrained assumptions we have about transmedia engagement.

TWiB!, which functions simultaneously as both a broadcast-style network and a social media network, created an interactive, multi-media, trans-platform space where listeners and TWiB! staff came together to express their grief and anger. Drawing on longstanding Black traditions of both public and private counter-discourse production, TWiB! rejected colorblindness and reified a Black collective identity at a moment of racial turmoil.

After pointing to the limited explanatory potential of rationalist models of resource mobilisation and political opportunity structures in the case at hand, the article offers to investigate the extent to which the Internet provided new, immaterial territories over which discontent could prosper. Importing Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of ‘territorialisation’ in the study of contentious politics, the article proposes to apprehend social movements on the basis of the inclusiveness and thickness of their territorial foundations and hypothesises that immaterial territories of struggle gave rise to an extremely inclusive but fairly shallow social movement, which was only able to solve basic collective action problems. More complex forms of collective action were conducted in less inclusive communities with thicker territorial foundations.

It serves both as a solution to the problem of curating massive collections of user-generated content and as a rhetorical justification for platform owners when they decide to remove content. Flags are becoming a ubiquitous mechanism of governance—yet their meaning is anything but straightforward. In practice, the interactions between users, flags, algorithms, content moderators, and platforms are complex and highly strategic. Significantly, flags are asked to bear a great deal of weight, arbitrating both the relationship between users and platforms, and the negotiation around contentious public issues. In this essay, we unpack the working of the flag, consider alternatives that give greater emphasis to public deliberation, and consider the implications for online public discourse of this now commonplace yet rarely studied sociotechnical mechanism.

Degrees of alarming or reassuring tones differed by platform as well.

This article examines the uproar surrounding Sephora's Starter Witch Kit as it played out on Twitter. The debate on Twitter included Witches protesting the appropriation and commodification of their sacred traditions, as well as outsiders who questioned the right of Witches to complain about spiritual theft. This Twitter debate was an opportunity for Modern Witches to substantiate and legitimize their identities as Witches. Witches distinguished their identities as ""authentic"" by mocking certain products and consumers, and demarcated practices/traditions as distinctive of Witchcraft by calling them sacred. By accusing Sephora of spiritual theft, Witches also largely elided their own engagement with appropriation from religious traditions.

The political efficacy of testing is traced through two mini-case studies: the Philippines and the United States. The case studies follow the approach of populism scholars in drawing from various sources that 'render the populist style visible' from the tweets and press releases of government officials to media reportage. Using the framework of medical populism, the case studies pay attention to the ways in which coronavirus testing figured in (1) simplification of the pandemic; (2) spectacularization of the crisis; (3) forging of divisions; and (4) invocation of knowledge claims. Identifying and critically analyzing how knowledge is generated is an essential step to recognizing the impact that political styles have on the COVID pandemic. The political actors in each case study have shaped knowledge of the epidemic, in the way they construct the idea of 'testing', and in how they mobilize testing as an 'evidence-making practice'. Their actions shaped how the pandemic--as well as their responses--is measured. This framework contributes to public policy debates by providing evidence of the impact of medical populism on pandemic response efforts.

Likewise, in order to obtain a wider perspec-tive of both campaigns on the same social network, the issues forming the subject of each candidates' agendas in the same period were studied.

Proposing the notion of a distributed fandom affinity space, we explore parents' discourse on Twitter around the commonly adopted hashtag #Bluey and discern several fundamental categories of posts that provide insight into child and metarecipient parent fandom in the #Bluey affinity space. The tweets revolve around the concepts of parenting, family life, education and language that arise from watching Bluey, which both parents and children evaluate in positive terms.

Results reveal that there are several features significantly associated with higher engagement, such as images and hashtags, ergo increasing community outreach and participation, as well as the likelihood of efficiently and successfully solving these cases.

These people are often vulnerable, and their safe and early return is a key factor in preventing them from coming to serious harm. One approach to quickly find missing people is to disseminate appeals for information using social media. Yet despite the popularity of twitter-based missing person appeals, presently little is known about how to best construct these messages to ensure they are shared widely. This paper aims to build an evidence-base for understanding how police accounts tweet appeals for information about missing persons, and how the public engage with these tweets by sharing them. We analyse 1008 Tweets made by Greater Manchester Police between the period of 2011 and 2018 in order to investigate what features of the tweet, the twitter account, and the missing person are associated with levels of retweeting. We find that tweets with different choice of image, wording, sentiment, and hashtags vary in how much they are retweeted. Tweets that use custody images have lower retweets than Tweets with regular photos, while tweets asking the question 'have you seen ... ?' and asking explicitly to be retweeted have more engagement in the form of retweets. These results highlight the need for conscientious, evidence-based crafting of missing appeals, and pave the way for further research into the causal mechanisms behind what affects engagement, to develop guidance for police forces worldwide.

Drawing on a content analysis of Canadian police departments' Twitter accounts, this article discusses the types of information sent out to the public (i.e. on crimes/investigations, police work, safety/traffic, and community) as well as police attempts to interact with citizens (i.e. through invitations to attend events, asking for responses, and responding to and/or mentioning others). The findings suggest that Twitter was used to help manage the image of the police and build community. The implications of these findings are also discussed.

Drawing on a combination of interviews, focus groups, policy documents, and social media data, this article explores the NPS's motivations and goals in using social media. It also highlights many of the challenges they have faced in implementing their strategy. The research finds that while the use of social media in policing aims to decentralise police communication efforts, in Kenya is has recentralized them. Furthermore, instead of reforming the way the police and public interact, it often serves to reinforce existing practices. While social media does not yet seem to be revolutionising the way the police engage with the public in Kenya, there are indications that the public is receptive to police social media accounts. In an environment where there is little trust in the police, this openness to engagement is considered an encouraging achievement within the NPS.

The internet hashtag movement emerged from quality investigative journalism, and the movement has done what the law could not (MacKinnon 2018). Examining tweets that include the English version of the hashtag, Lee and Murdie (2020) found that women are more likely to engage in #MeToo in countries where their political rights are better protected. This finding, however, does not seem to fit East Asia's experience. The region's earliest and longest democracy, Japan, had a much milder movement than neighboring South Korea. Many South Korean women publicly named their perpetrators, but Japanese women, when sharing their experience of being harassed, mostly remained anonymous (Hasunuma and Shin 2019). Moreover, Taiwan, arguably the most gender-equal country in this region—if measured by women's political representation (42% in the national legislature) or by policies toward sexual minorities (it was the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage)—has had virtually no #MeToo movement.

Four consistent trends were identified across these four contexts, with important implications for the study of social movements, youth activism, gender, sexuality, and race. First, levels of emotional taxation resulting from LGBTQI activist work were consistently very high. Second, emotional burdens were systematically greater for young, nonwhite, and transgender activists. Third, emotional taxation was compounded for activists whose identities crossed multiple marginalized groups. This finding supports the validity and importance of intersectional approaches to LGBTQI issues. Fourth, the sources of emotional taxation varied greatly among activists, and transgender activists were particularly stressed by public engagements such as major events and marches. Transgender nonwhite activists also indicated relatively high levels of emotional stress related to online forms of engagement, such as posting on Twitter and Facebook. These findings could help identify the kinds of activists who participate, the kinds of issues advocated for, and why certain tactics are used.

Initially, scholarship on the personalization of politics focused on what was often called “candidate-centered” voting: the idea that citizens would vote based on a candidate's personality. Many scholars viewed this evaluative approach as irrational and heralded the value of issue stances over charisma (see Fenno 1978; Popkin 1991). Focusing on the personal, it seems, was problematic. Another iteration of the personalization in politics was also problematic and focused on the use of the “personal frame” in news coverage of women candidates. Such news coverage focused more on women's personalities and personal lives as compared to men's (e.g., Bystrom 1999; Devitt 1999). On its surface, such coverage does not appear detrimental. However, this framing would often emphasize women's roles as mothers and wives and use that framing to question women's experience, fitness for office, and whether they could juggle domestic and political responsibilities (Braden 1996). Personalization in both iterations elicited a sense of triviality: voters’ focus on persona was deemed as a trivial way to form an opinion, and women candidates were trivialized via a focus on their personal, not political, lives.

Before the digital revolution, the relationship between the politician and the voter was intermediated by journalists and broadcast media. In contrast to traditional media, social media are presumed to enable politicians to engage directly with the electorate (Kruikemeier, Van Noort, Vliegenthart & De Vreese, 2015). In the last decade, there was a growing interest in the role of social media in election campaigns, triggered by Barack Obama's electoral presidential election victory in 2008 and more recently by Donald Trumps' triumph in 2016 (Rodriguez-Andres, 2018). The research presented in this article answers three main questions. First, who are the politicians using Twitter for campaigning purposes and what variables can predict Twitter use? Second, when do Belgian politicians use it and with which frequency? And third: do tweeting politicians perform better at the ballot box? The main findings reveal that a Flemish candidate has a higher probability of 18,7% to be present on Twitter compared to a candidate from the French community. Another important finding is that there is no significant association between the number of tweets and number of preferential votes, although a trend towards significance was observed for Flemish politicians.

Credibility is essential in this respect. Due to the mediated nature of political communication, citizens base their credibility evaluation on leaders' media presentations and the public debate in the media that develops in response to it. The source credibility approach suggests that leaders are credible if citizens consider them competent, trustworthy, and caring. What remains underexplored is how these evaluations of leaders' source credibility come about and how changes in them can be understood. To this end, we introduce the concept of enacted credibility. Enacted credibility entails the framing and reframing of leaders' credibility in the interaction between political leaders' performance, citizens, and other participants in the public debate in the media. Empirically we explore the relevance of this concept by studying the case of Dutch Social Democratic leader Job Cohen. We found that the interplay among and between participants in the public debate in the media and his media performance is key to understanding the substantial decline in his source credibility during the 2010 parliamentary election campaign. Our analysis shows that some dimensions of credibility became more salient in the public debate in the media than others, impacting the overall evaluation of his source credibility.

Our findings build on previous research which to date has largely presumed that Twitter outreach is characterized by relatively homogenous in-party communication patterns, and has identified only limited evidence that representative ethnicity impacts digital home style.

In this paper, we present a semi-supervised methodology that uses our Discriminatory Expressions algorithm for feature selection to detect expressions that are biased towards extremist content (Francisco and Castro 2020). With the help of human experts, the relevant expressions are filtered and used to retrieve further extremist content in order to iteratively provide a set of relevant and accurate expressions.

This article combines two methodological approaches to study the content shared by al-Arefe on his Twitter account: a quantitative method and a qualitative one. I focus on the analysis of three elements present among the contents shared by this preacher on his Twitter account: Hashtags, visuals and links. Finally, my analysis shows how al-Arefe focuses more on his person and his image than he focuses on presenting Islamic teachings.

While easily accessible, the use of ""public"" posts raises important questions about the ethics of mining, storing, analyzing, and reporting publicly available social media data—especially when gathering sensitive information such as sexual violence disclosures. Online movements including #MeToo and #WhyIDidntReport emerged to shed light on gender-based violence. These movements generate large quantities of data with little consistency and oversight across research groups, disciplines, and review boards on data ethics. With the recent push in social science to publish data to open science databases, the concerns of feminist psychologists and ethical concerns of social media research with survivors have become more salient. In this article, we describe and address these ethical issues by reviewing existing social media sexual assault disclosure research and make concrete recommendations for authors seeking to use social media data. We also seek to address these ethical concerns by noting the work of some feminist researchers, but also by pushing researchers to do more for survivors through a survivor-informed approach to this research in an open science context. We propose four survivor-informed recommendations for research with this vulnerable population: (a) get input from survivors, (b) update ethics review boards, (c) maximize benefits to participants, and (d) utilize study-appropriate datasets with informed consent.

For data scientists, adding demographic variables and comparisons to closed-ended survey responses have the potential to improve interpretations of inferences drawn from social media—for example, through comparisons of online expressions and survey responses, and by assessing associations with offline outcomes like voting. For survey methodologists, adding social media data to surveys allows for rich behavioral measurements, including comparisons of public expressions with attitudes elicited in a structured survey. Here, we evaluate two popular forms of linkages—administrative and survey—focusing on two questions: How does the method of creating a sample of Twitter users affect its behavioral and demographic profile? What are the relative advantages of each of these methods? Our analyses illustrate where and to what extent the sample based on administrative data diverges in demographic and partisan composition from surveyed Twitter users who report being registered to vote. Despite demographic differences, each linkage method results in behaviorally similar samples, especially in activity levels; however, conventionally sized surveys are likely to lack the statistical power to study subgroups and heterogeneity (e.g. comparing conversations of Democrats and Republicans) within even highly salient political topics. We conclude by developing general recommendations for researchers looking to study social media by linking accounts with external benchmark data sources.

We expect and find the greatest correspondence when Twitter data were used to predict perceptions of recent societal economic change, rather than the aggregations of pocketbook economic experiences or reports of the state of the economy. In contrast to the concerns many scholars have raised about nonprobability data sources, the results suggest that correspondence between Twitter data and survey data did not depend on how similar Twitter users were to the population. Finally, we find evidence that the correspondences that did emerge were highly variable over time and appeared to be induced in the presence of economic volatility, suggesting that consistent long-scale trends may not be driven by consistent small-scale mechanisms.

In particular, we examine the dynamics of expressions of regional prejudice on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. Furthermore, we explain online expressions of regional prejudice through the lens of the group-threat and contact theories, and seek potential conditions that facilitate the development of a positive relationship between local residents and migrants. Our findings lend strong support to the group-contact argument that migrant inflows reduce online expressions of regional prejudice in China. The contact effect is larger when migrant inflows are measured in terms of migrant labor and interprovince migrants, who represent China's typical migrants. Furthermore, the contact effect is only observed in relatively small cities, while a small threat effect is observed in mega and super-mega cities where the population-control system is strictly maintained.

We contribute to this debate by drawing on Wittgensteinian philosophy to elucidate hitherto neglected aspects; namely that it is not just social scientists who are in the business of analysing social media, but users themselves. We explore how mainstream social media analytics research (1) overinflates the importance of sociological theories, concepts and methodologies (which do not typically feature in the accounts of social media users), (2) downplays the extent to which social media platforms already exhibit order prior to any sociological accounting of them, and, (3) thereby produces findings which explain social scientific perspectives rather than the phenomena themselves. We reformulate the ontological and epistemological basis of social media analytics research from a Wittgensteinian perspective concerned with what it makes sense to say about social media, as members of society and as researchers studying those members. Such a project aims to explore social media users' language as a practice embedded within the context of social life and online communication. This reflects the everyday use of language as an evolving toolkit for undertaking social interaction, pointing towards an alternative conception of social media analytics.",Big Data; BIG DATA; CRISIS; CHALLENGES; social media analytics; epistemology; TWITTER; ontology; ordinary language philosophy; philosophy of social science; Wittgenstein,WOS,,,,,,,,

As further indicated in the Latin root absurdus, ""out of tune, uncouth, inappropriate, ridiculous,"" humor in absurd registers plays with that which is out of harmony with both reason and decency. In this article, the authors make an argument for the absurd as a feminist method for tackling heterosexism. Design/methodology/approach: By focusing on the Twitter account ""Men Write Women"" (est. 2019), the rationale of which is to share literary excerpts from male authors describing women's experiences, thoughts and appearances, and which regularly broadens into social theater in the user reactions, the study explores the critical value of absurdity in feminist social media tactics. Findings: The study proposes the absurd as a means of not merely turning things around, or inside out, but disrupting and eschewing the hegemonic logic on offer. While both absurd humor and feminist activism may begin from a site of reactivity and negative evaluation, it need not remain confined to it. Rather, by turning things preposterous, ludicrous and inappropriate, absurd laughter ends up somewhere different. The feminist value of absurd humor has to do with both its critical edge and with the affective lifts and spaces of ambiguity that it allows for. Originality/value: Research on digital feminist activism has largely focused on the affective dynamics of anger. As there are multiple affective responses to sexism, our article foregrounds laughter and ambivalence as a means of claiming space differently in online cultures rife with hate, sexism and misogyny.

Drawing on the example of Twitter, this article redresses this gap in the literature, by exploring how social media is changing the way research is conducted and promoted in relation to (1) measuring scholarly impact via altmetrics; (2) engaging with research participants; (3) networking and making collegial connections; and (4) advocating for social issues in the public realm. As we highlight tensions in each of these four areas, a key concern is how and for whom social media is contributing to the changing meaning of scholarly impact and engagement in research communities. We draw specific attention to how the inequalities that exist in academia writ large may be amplified on social media thus affecting overall engagement and perceived impact for researchers from marginalized social locations (e.g. gender, race, sexual orientation). We conclude by discussing specific implications of using social media in qualitative social work research and provide suggestions for future areas of inquiry.

Through the #prayforparis Twitter network, this study attempted (1) to identify top influentials by applying multiple centrality measures and word frequency measures and (2) to examine social roles based on structural signatures of the Twitter network through the lens of the Diffusion of Innovation Theory. To fulfill the objectives of this study, the authors employed an innovative multi-method approach combining Social Network Analysis, word frequency analysis via NodeXL and R, and a qualitative approach to examine behavioral and structural relationships of the #prayforparis Twitter network. Top influentials of the network were pop music celebrities who shared condolences to the victims of the 2015 Paris attacks through their tweets. This study identified ""celebrity"" and ""fan"" as social roles based on the structural and qualitative analysis of the network as well as metrical examinations, including indegree and outdegree counts of the social roles of the ""celebrities"" and ""fans."" Justin Bieber, the most dominant influential individual in the #prayforparis Twitter network, functioned as a breaking news provider through his tweet about the death of his friend during the Paris attacks. By filling the gap from the past studies, this study utilizes the theoretical improvement in the diffusion research as well as contributes to the methodological approach about influentials and social roles in the Twitter network.

The article raises the question about how researchers' subjective decisions affect the performance of supervised deep learning models. The aim is to deliver practical advice for researchers concerning: (1) whether it is more efficient to monitor coders' work to ensure a high quality training dataset or have every document coded once and obtain a larger dataset instead; (2) whether lemmatisation improves model performance; (3) if it is better to apply passive learning or active learning approaches; and (4) if the answers are dependent on the models' classification tasks. The models were trained to detect if a tweet is about current affairs or political issues, the tweet's subject matter and the tweet author's stance on this. The study uses a sample of 200,000 manually coded tweets published by Polish political opinion leaders in 2019. The consequences of decisions under different conditions were checked by simulating 52,800 results using the fastText algorithm (DV: F1-score). Linear regression analysis suggests that the researchers' choices not only strongly affect model performance but may also lead, in the worst-case scenario, to a waste of funds.

To overcome this problem, and allow to employ twitter data for descriptive and predictive purposes, in this contribution we propose an effective statistical method that formalises and extends a quality index employed in the context of the evaluation of academic research, the h index, renamed T index. Our proposal will be tested on a list of twitterers described by the Financial Times as 'the top financial tweeters to follow', for the year 2013. Using our methodology we rank these twitterers and provide confidence intervals to decide whether they are significantly different. Moreover through a sentiment analysis, we employ the twitters content to estimate graphical models useful in the context of financial systemic risk. To this aim we focus on the Italian bank system and we show how listed banks are connected on the basis of tweets data.

In order to quantify the current political situations, this study employed network analysis and the model fitting method with co-occurrence web visibility data of political parties and their leaders in four platforms. The findings demonstrated to what extent web ecologies on four different online platforms during the given election reflect the country's political situation. Comparing network centralizations across platforms, results showed that online news was the least biased media and Twitter was the most biased with the highest centralization scores. Although both the ruling party and the major opposition party-including the leaders of those two parties-had higher degree centrality scores than minor parties and their leaders in all platforms, some distinct features were observed in Twitter and Facebook due to their attributes.

The aim of this paper is to develop a systemic risk model which, differently from existing ones, employs not only the information contained in financial market prices, but also big data coming from financial tweets. From a methodological viewpoint, we propose a new framework, based on categorical graphical models, that can estimate systemic risks with models based on two different sources: financial markets and financial tweets, and suggest a way to combine them, using a Bayesian approach. From an applied viewpoint, we present the first systemic risk model based on big data, and show that such a model can shed further light on the interrelationships between financial institutions. This can help predicting the level of returns of a bank, conditionally on the others, for example when a shock occurs in another bank.

An orientation in Habermas's work, that we use, is analysis of communication or discourse. For this, we take Twitter social media. In our case study, we map the discourse semantically, using the correspondence analysis platform for such latent semantic analysis. This permits qualitative and quantitative analytics. Our case study is a set of eight carefully planned Twitter campaigns relating to environmental issues. The aim of these campaigns was to increase environmental awareness and behaviour. Each campaign was launched by an initiating tweet. Using the data gathered in these Twitter campaigns, we sought to map them, and hence to track the flow of the Twitter discourse. This mapping was achieved through semantic embedding. The semantic distance between an initiating act and the aggregate semantic outcome is used as a measure of process effectiveness.

This classification is often based on a bag-of-words approach that counts the frequencies of sentiment terms from a predefined vocabulary, ignoring the contexts for these words. We test an aspect-based network analysis model that computes sentiment about an entity from the shortest paths between the sentiment words and the target word across a corpus. Two ground-truth datasets in which human annotators judged whether tweets were positive or negative enabled testing the internal and external validity of the automated network-based method, evaluating the extent to which this approach's scoring corresponds to the annotations. We found that tweets annotated as negative had an automated negativity score that was nearly twice as strong than positivity, while positively annotated tweets were six times stronger in positivity than negativity. To assess the predictive validity of the approach, we analyzed sentiment associated with coronavirus coverage in television news from January 1 to March 25, 2020. Support was found for the four hypotheses tested, demonstrating the utility of the approach. H1: broadcast news expresses less sentiment about coronavirus, panic, and social distancing than non-broadcast news outlets. H2: there is a negative bias in the news across channels. H3: sentiment increases are associated with an increased volume of news stories. H4: sentiment is associated with uncertainty in news coverage of coronavirus over time. We also found that as the type of channel moved from broadcast network news to 24-h business, general, and foreign news sentiment increased for coronavirus, panic, and social distancing.

An Analysis of Online Harassment Towards Black and Latinx Women,RACE AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS,10.1007/s12552-021-09330-7,,"Online harassment is a growing societal problem. Although online harassment, or cyber aggression, has begun to receive attention, little research systematically explores the common themes found in hostile messages. In this project, we focused on online harassment directed towards women of color. We applied social network methodology and text clustering (topic analysis) to messages posted on the social media platform Twitter. We examined the occurrence of aggressive, harmful Twitter messages directed towards two groups-Hispanic/Latinx women and Black women. Next, we uncovered common themes that emerged within the communications. Messages towards both groups of women contained themes of racial stereotypes. In tweets that targeted Black women, one emergent theme concerned charges of promiscuity, where messages included slurs that accused Black women of being overly sexual. In messages containing Latinx slurs, on the other hand, xenophobia was one recurring topic, with common terms related to menial labor and political comments invoking the need to ""build a wall."" Both groups of women also were subjected to feminine, attractiveness insults. Findings suggest that these negative communications are not idiosyncratic in nature, but instead routinely reinforce traditional, negative, race and gender stereotypes. As a result, these hostile messages contribute to the maintenance of race and gender inequality.",Social media; Gender; GENDER; Networks; Race; NETWORKS; Cyberbullying; AGGRESSION; ANTI-IMMIGRANT; INTERSECTIONALITY; Online harassment; POPULATIONS; VICTIMIZATION,WOS,,,,,,,,

Talkback radio has been traditionally perceived as a participatory form of media, albeit limited by various gatekeeping and rules of access. However, the nature of talkback with its traditional reliance on voice and performance is changing as programmes are increasingly offering audience members the opportunity to contribute to programmes via e-mail, Short Messaging Service (SMS) and, more recently, websites and social media. This article contributes to an under-explored area of talkback radio studies by examining audience 'participation' in talkback programmes via SMS and e-mail. It draws data from focus groups with audiences of twelve Australian commercial and non-commercial talkback radio programmes to discover why some study participants use SMS and e-mail and why some do not contribute via these technologies. The article also examines, in what circumstances and for what purposes these talkback radio listeners use these technologies. Inductive coding was used to analyse the data through the computer program NVivo. We conclude that while study participants strongly associated talkback with phone calls, e-mail and SMS are largely accepted as regular methods of contributing to and communicating with talkback radio programmes. There is much more work to be undertaken on the topic of non-verbal contributions to talkback radio, particularly with the increasing use of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which this article has not explored.

The survey has been carried out by a team of ten European researchers from seven countries on a sample of 28 public radio programmes analysed for two months between January and February 2011. The research team attempted to answer the empirical question: 'How social media are used by public service?'. Are there some common threads and shared practices among successful programmes in different countries? The team adopted an empirical approach based on social media content analysis and interviews with radio producers. This article will present the main results of this empirical research project.

Since social media platforms seem to provide an increasingly relevant space for generational stereotyping that highlights conflict between younger and older generations, investigating ageism towards older people expressed on social media during the pandemic is deemed particularly important. This article explores ageing discourses circulated within the Italian Twittersphere during the first peak of the Covid-19 emergency. It draws on a dataset of 7M+ Covid-related tweets collected in the first phase of the health crises. Through quanti-qualitative analysis, it explores Twitter content related to Covid-19 and older people: 110,316 tweets detected taking advantage of a set of ad hoc keywords (e.g., anzian*, vecch*). Drawing on our findings, we show that explicit stereotypical opinions are quite residual, and we put forth and discuss the concept of platformised ageing discourse to explain how social media platforms' structure and functioning affect ageing-related cultural production.

The latter deems the Internet as a fragmented and individualized space, which, by definition, destroys any possibility of collective deliberation and discussion. However few scholars have systematically examined the empirical relation between politics and social media. Through a quantitative-qualitative analysis, grounded on the digital methods paradigms and based on a dataset of 181085 tweets collected during the Primarie of Centro Sinistra 2012, we would like to show how Twitter can be conceived of as a civic device that permits a specific political discourse and new forms of political association to be materialized - both entities that would remain unseen otherwise. In the end we suggest that it is possible to construct a new theory of the digital public sphere starting from the Tardian notion of public.

Thus, students' perceptions of teacher credibility are affected by what instructors post on their social media profiles. The participants in the study were 166 students from the Faculty of Education Sciences at the University of Seville, carried out using a quasiexperimental methodology for which three Twitter profiles for a university professor were created with professional, social and mixed content. For the analysis of the results, normality and homoscedasticity tests were carried out on the sample to decide which statistical tests to use. The most salient results indicated that students perceived the professional profile as more competent, more caring, and more trustworthy, followed by the mixed profile and, lastly, by the social profile. Positive correlations were also found between students who perceived the university professor as reflected in the professional profile as credible in their academic motivation. The findings and their practical implications for instructors are discussed in terms of how they can incorporate Twitter into their teaching, considering the needs of their students to enhance their learning.

Initial work by Lovejoy and Saxton suggests NGOs use digital platforms such as Twitter to engage their constituencies through information dissemination, community building, and mobilization to action. Here, we explore the applicability of Lovejoy and Saxton’s communicative functions framework to resistance movement behavior by exploring two examples of digital engagement in political conflict. Through content analysis of tweets using hashtag indicators #BDS and #ICC4Israel collected during the spring of 2015, we affirm Lovejoy and Saxton’s findings that information dissemination is the most prevalent communication function for grassroots and institutionally grounded movements. Further, we find that informational tweets in our sample often provide information about grievances, and therefore propose an expansion of the framework to accommodate tweets that may be more common in resistance movements than in NGO communication. In addition to general findings about the communicative functions framework, the content analysis yielded several findings specific to the resistance movements studied. Notably, we find that #BDS and #ICC4Israel tweets are overwhelmingly nonviolent, and that sentiment is generally favorable across both hashtags, with the exception of tweets focusing on academic boycott, which were more ambiguous.

Recently, this trend has manifested through several high-profile incidents of foreign firms censoring controversial content outside of China in order to retain access to the Chinese consumer market. This article argues that China is uniquely situated to leverage this type of market power due to its enormous, growing consumer base and authoritarian structure. This form of 'exporting' censorship can occur in three ways: content bans, position reversal, and self-censorship. Outward-facing firms, especially in the entertainment industry, are particularly vulnerable to this type of pressure as their employees, including actors, athletes, and celebrity CEOs, may have an independent following and audience for their personal views. By analyzing the controversy between China and the National Basketball Association over a single tweet in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, this article demonstrates the conditions under which censorship efforts may be outsourced to private, foreign actors in jurisdictions outside of China.

Joe Biden, who based his election campaign on democracy and diversity, took the oath of office as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021. His inauguration ceremony was marked by a call for “unity”. The ceremony became the agenda of social media as well as traditional media, and users simultaneously shared posts reflecting their views and attitudes on social media platforms. Most of these posts (on Twitter) were made using the hashtags #DonaldTrump and #inaugurationday. The discussion and political polarization that started during the election process continued after the election through social networks. In the study, the role of Twitter in digital democracy as well as its potential to serve as a public space were examined through the network and its features, interactions, and factions that were formed within the framework of the related hashtags on the inauguration day (January 20, 2021). Methodologically, social network analysis was utilized. The results indicate that the political agenda-setters on Twitter are dominating and resonate with users in terms of interaction.

The academic literature has seen a rise in interest in the micro-blogging platform. For instance, Adi and Moloney (2012) assess the strategic uses of Twitter by protest groups, Adi, Erickson and Lilleker (2014) reflect on the networks and use pattern of the same platform by politicians, namely UK Labor party representatives in the House of Lords while Adi and Grigore (2015) analyze the strategic uses of social media by corporations. Bajpai and Jaiswal (2011) on the other hand propose a framework for analyzing collective action events on Twitter and so do the creators behind visual analysis platforms like NodeXL, Gephi, Linkurious and Socioviz. Public Relations research too has provided several reflections and analyses of Twitter. Verhoeven et al (2012) and Sweetsner and Kelleher discuss how practitioners use social media; Lovejoy, Waters and Saxton evaluate how NGO are engaging stakeholders though the new medium, while Saffer, Sommerfeldt and Taylor (2013) suggest that Twitter interactivity influences the quality of organization-public relationships. With questions about the professionalization of Public Relations as well as about the portrayals and perceptions of the profession continuing to intrigue researchers, it is surprising that only Xifra and Grau (2010) looked into the type of information shared in tweets about public relations. Using the Twitter data collection and analysis option from Socioviz this paper provides an exploratory account of the #publicrelations on Twitter. Using the visualizations provided by the platform and automated data analysis to gain insight into over 10,000 tweets published during June 15-24 and July 15-24, this paper qualitatively assesses the emerging themes about public relations focusing on association of hashtags and type of messages shared and identifies the most active and most influential users within the issue topic. The paper reveals that the #publicrelations is often associated with #jobs or is hijacked and associated with tags such as #gossip or #entertainment. The paper also shows that conversation in the #publicrelations issue network is limited and that the hashtag only partially includes content relevant to the practice. In doing so the paper raises important questions about the nature of dialogue and symmetry on social media and their assessment and suggests that further research should explore twitter chats as well as continue to apply similar data collection methods as used for the study.

This article starts from the assumption that presidential candidates use the online communication tools in order to convey negative messages about their opponents. The hypothesis of the study was that the candidates used Internet, especially social media, in the negative campaign for attacking the competitors.

One reason is that local government-owned social media is less appealing. This research argues that to increase public involvement in social media, the government needs to understand public behavior on social media by exploring public preferences on the content and media produced. This research applies a Stakeholder Engagement Index (SEI) to study public behavior on social media. The results of the study demonstrate that although content containing information about government activities has been produced, it has a low engagement level. Moreover, people prefer content with photos and videos, which apparently dominate local government posts and tweets. This research academically confirms that SEI is an alternative method for understanding public behavior on social media and practically presents choices of content categories preferred by the public.

Thus, in the case of certain states such as the USA, Iran or Moldova, microblogging – especially through the platform Twitter – proved an efficient communication tool. Sharing is emerging as a way of distributing the news—tweets from the streets of Iran and from the rubble of Haiti have been retweeted hundreds of times in a new, virtual form of word of mouth. But what was the case of Romania, considering that, at the end of 2009, presidential elections were held here? The aim of the paper is to explore whether communication in 140 characters has had an influence on the Romanian presidential elections in 2009. The paper was facilitated by the online project Elections in 140 characters developed on the microblogging platform Cirip.eu, by creating at the start of the campaign a group dedicated to the presidential elections. Messages on this topic were sent in this group, and were also imported both from Twitter and from blogs, all of them reflecting the interaction/debate on the elections, between Romanian Internet users. However, the authors believe that if microblogging is used effectively it has the potential to do more than facilitate interaction between users (or users and candidates).

However, many of these movements have continued to face the classic challenges of social movements, particularly consistency and sustainability. As such, a number of movements have dissolved as they have been unable to accumulate and allocate their resources. This article has taken on internet-based social movement, Akademi Berbagi (Akber), for an instrumental case study. Akber is a movement that has emerged and been active almost wholly through Twitter, with its main goal being to promote sociocultural change at the individual level, particularly in the field of education. This article seeks to analyse the organizational management of Akber, referring specifically to its organizational efforts and strategies to accumulate and allocate its resources. Data were collected through interviews and online/offline observations, as well as investigation of the digital documents from the official social media accounts of Akber and its members. This research finds that the optimal management of socio-cultural movements such as Akber relies on several factors, including the use of various internet platforms, the loose federal organizational structure, the movement's ability to avoid the trap of pseudo-support, and the ability to respond to external changes.

Conventional understandings of the presentation of self and work in cognitive psychology provide different understandings of whether labeling misinformation in social media posts will reduce sharing behavior. Part of the problem with understanding whether interventions will work hinges on how closely social media interactions mirror other interpersonal interactions with friends and associates in the offline world. Our analysis looks at rates of misinformation labeling during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic on Facebook and Twitter, and then assesses whether sharing behavior is deterred by misinformation labels applied to social media posts. Our results suggest that labeling is relatively successful at lowering sharing behavior. We discuss how our results contribute to a larger understanding of the role of existing inequalities and government responses to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Code-switching incorporates government, cultural, religious and network contexts, and the frequency of code-switching in such multilingual conversations is an indicator of the global dominance of multilingualism. Online communication fosters social communicative practices consisting of code-switching and marks the development of verbal behaviour of multilingual communities. Code-switching also affects language visuality, its images are tools for the social construction of reality. The developed verbal practices support effective communication and affect the expression of new meanings. The article aims at presenting the features of code-switching in digital communication with 8 examples of different length, topic and author, in which the native Lithuanians code-switched to English and used elements of the Internet language. These examples were taken from the social networks Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, and the authors analyzed the grammar, spelling and punctuation of both Lithuanian and the English words, the type and use of the code-switched English elements, special characters, abbreviations, emoji and other features of the Internet language. The results show that online communication is not entirely textual, with various means of text composition communicators make their code-switched English elements more visible and alter the appearance of messages. Such practices correspond to the features of social networks and seem to follow the popular Internet culture trends.",social networks; computer-mediated communication; visuality; code-switching; Internet language; multilingualism; verbal behaviour,WOS,,,,,,,,

The current study takes a generalizable approach to examining the prevalence of posting about alcohol on a popular social media platform, Twitter, as well as examining the predictors of a tweet’s virality. We content-analyzed more than 47.5 million tweets that were posted in March 2015 to explore the prevalence of alcohol-related references, and how alcohol-related references, tweet features (e.g., inclusion of hashtags, pictures, etc.), and user characteristics (e.g., number of followers) contribute to the tweet’s virality. Our findings showed that during March 2015, about two of every 100 tweets in the United States were alcohol-related; whereas the majority of those referenced intoxication. In addition to tweet features and user characteristics, the prevalence of alcohol-related references in a tweet positively predicted the number of likes it received, yet negatively predicted the number of retweets. Given prior evidence supporting the association between social media use and alcohol consumption, the prevalence of alcohol references in tweets and how that contributes to their virality offers insights into the widespread phenomenon of glorifying alcohol use and excessive drinking via social media, pointing to potential negative health consequences.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

We then quantify the ideological distributions of users’ online political and media environments by merging validated estimates of user ideology with the full set of accounts followed by our survey respondents (N = 642,345) and the available tweets posted by those accounts (N 1.2 billion). We study the extent to which liberals and conservatives encounter counter-attitudinal messages in two distinct ways: (a) by the accounts they follow and (b) by the tweets they receive from those accounts, either directly or indirectly (via retweets). More than a third of respondents do not follow any media sources, but among those who do, we find a substantial amount of overlap (51%) in the ideological distributions of accounts followed by users on opposite ends of the political spectrum.

Contemporary social media presents a new opportunity to test these hypotheses. This study examines whether users of the social media platform Twitter in larger and denser American cities tweet at a faster rate than their counterparts in smaller and sparser ones. Contrary to how telephony usage and productivity scale superlinearly with city population, the total volume of tweets in cities scales sublinearly. This is similar to the economies of scale in city infrastructures like gas stations. When looking at individuals, however, greater population density is associated with faster tweeting. The discrepancy between the ecological correlation and individual behavior is resolved by noting that larger cities have sublinear growth in the number of active Twitter users. This suggests that there is a more concentrated core of more active users that may serve an information broadcast function for larger cities, an emerging group of “town tweeters” as it were.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Individual words were identified and treated within the selected tweets, excluding stop words and, finally, using a sparsity index.

In addition, the election spurred a new level of social media coverage. The current study analyzed the language of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from the debates as well as the tweets of millions of people during the fall presidential campaign. In addition, aggregated polling data allowed for a comparison of daily election-relevant language from Twitter and fluctuations in voter preference. Overall, Trump’s debate language was low in analytic/formal thinking and high in negative emotional tone and authenticity. Clinton was high in analytic and positive emotions, low in authenticity. The analysis of almost 10 million tweets revealed that Trump-relevant tweets were generally more positive than Clinton-related tweets. Most important were lag analyses that predicted polling numbers a week later from tweets. In general, when Clinton-related tweets were more analytic, her subsequent poll numbers dropped. Similarly, positive emotion language in the Clinton-related tweets predicted lower poll numbers a week later. Conversely, Trump-related tweets that were high in positive emotion and in analytic thinking predicted higher subsequent polling. In other words, when Twitter language about the candidates was used in ways inconsistent with the candidates themselves, their poll numbers went up. We propose two possible explanations for these findings: the projection hypothesis, a desire to seek qualities the candidates are missing, and the participant hypothesis, a shift in who is participating in the Twitter conversation over the course of the campaigns.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

However, especially within the broader field of political communication, the uses of such services, as Twitter, at the hands of political actors such as politicians and the parties to which they belong, have become something of a fixture of research in recent years. Although the study of political Twitter use has provided a series of insightful case studies, often focused on one single election or country, this article presents a comparative study looking at Twitter use at the hands of political actors during two Norwegian elections, 2011 and 2013. We are interested in what overarching tendencies can be discerned from these uses—specifically, if differing usages can be found between the two elections, suggesting developments pertaining to the normalization and equalization hypotheses respectively. This is examined by focusing on two main analytical areas: The level and type of activity undertaken by those up for election, and the repercussions that this activity appears to have in terms of popularity on the studied platform. In short, the results suggest that although Twitter largely remains an “elite” medium in the Norwegian context, smaller political and other actors are making use of the platform at hand to higher degrees than their more well-known peers. Tendencies of both hypotheses are traced in the data, and although the findings could signal an opening for “outsiders” in this regard, the sheer amount of traffic driving the tweets sent by high-end politicians suggest otherwise.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Many commentators and political pundits criticize Trump for his disparaging rhetoric on Twitter and present him as an example of how Twitter can be an effective tool for the construction and extension of political polarization. The current study analyzes the selected tweets by Donald Trump posted on Twitter to unmask how he uses language to construct Islamophobic discourse structures and attempts to form his ideological structures along with. The researchers hypothesize that Islamophobia is a marked feature of Trump’s political career realized by specific rhetorical and discursive devices. Therefore, the study purposively takes 40 most controversial tweets of Donald Trump against Islam and Muslims and carried out a critical discourse analysis with the help of macro-strategies of the discourse given by Wodak and Meyer and van Dijk’s referential strategies of political discourse. The findings reveal that Trump uses language rhetorically to exclude people of different ethnic identities, especially Muslims, through demagogic language to create a difference of “us” vs. “them” and making in this way “America Great Again”.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

We analyze tweets containing links to news articles from eight of the largest national newspapers in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, and Germany. The data collection follows the first two weeks of October 2012 and includes 2,842,699 tweets with links to news articles. Twitter-shortened links were resolved using a three-pass routine and assigned to 1 of the 21 newspaper sections. We found the concentration of links to news articles posted by top users to be lower than reported in the literature and the strategy of relaying headlines on Twitter via automatic news aggregators (feeds) to be inefficient. The results of this investigation show which sections of a newspaper are the most and least read by readers in different parts of the world, with German readers placing greater emphasis on Politics and Economy; Brazilians on Sports and Arts; Spaniards on Local and National news; Britons and Americans on Opinion and World news. We also found that German and Spanish readers are more likely to read multiple national newspapers, while British readers more often resort to foreign sources of news. The results confirm that feedback to news items from a large user base is pivotal for the replication of content and that newspapers and news items can be clustered according to the editorial profile and principles of newsworthiness inherited from legacy media.

In particular, we analyzed how participation in a specific campaign and use of hashtags connected to the campaign developed over time and what kind of sub-flows of tweets or spinoff conversations emerged. The campaign hashtag that we observed later appeared in connection to sharing of an article that was not directly connected to the original campaign. Although both the original campaign and this sub-flow of it were connected to the broader context of climate change, the sub-flow formed a separate community of tweeters that did not overlap with tweeters participating in the original campaign. Twitter campaigns have flexible boundaries both around the shared issues and around the communities of tweeters. Our results show that using information spreading approach does not account for the evolution of campaign spreading on Twitter, as other factors, such as celebrity endorsement, may heavily influence the spread of information and content on Twitter. Thus, our results suggest that although different tweeters participated in the two separate campaigns using shared hashtags, hashtags per se do not always indicate shared communities of tweeters nor can they always be considered as indicators of completely shared issues online.",,SAGE,,,,,,,,

Who do people choose to argue with, and what brings them back to repeated exchanges? In short, why do people bother arguing online? We develop a model of argument engagement using a new dataset of Twitter conversations about President Trump. The model incorporates numerous user, tweet, and thread-level features to predict user participation in conversations with over 98% accuracy. We find that users are likely to argue over wide ideological divides, and are increasingly likely to engage with those who are different from themselves. In addition, we find that the emotional content of a tweet has important implications for user engagement, with negative and unpleasant tweets more likely to spark sustained participation. Although often negative, these extended discussions can bridge political differences and reduce information bubbles.

Such impacts are increasingly linked to a growing socio-spatial inequality and have served to politicise civil society's relationship with both platforms and tourism. As the more extractive platforms project themselves as sustainable, equitable ""alternatives"" to traditional accommodation business models, social protest and resistance collectives are increasingly vocal in projecting digital counter-narratives to this vision. This study analyses the impacts of Airbnb on the city of Barcelona and contextualises them within the digitally-networked narratives and counter-narratives that surround them. Different theoretical perspectives on traditional and digital activism are used to frame, on the one hand, the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings and on the other, an in-depth content analysis of Twitter conversations mentioning ""Airbnb"" and ""Barcelona"". Findings show that the Airbnb effect reinforces broader touristification processes, mainly in relation to housing access and affordability issues and residential displacement. In parallel, digital counter-narratives underline this process and call for regulatory intervention.

The dataset consists of 853,013 visits by 497,038 visitors. The results show a correlation between the distance travelled by an individual and the likelihood of attending a megastar concert. Visitors to megastar concerts are more likely to come from neighbouring countries and to spend less time in a destination than visitors to other events or regular visitors. The geography of visits to megastar concerts differs from that of other types of visits; on average, visitors to megastar concerts travel less within Estonia than other groups of visitors.

The victims of this phenomenon are women for the simple fact that their aggressors do not recognize their minimum rights of freedom, respect and decisionmaking. At the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, the UN acknowledged that violence against women is an obstacle to achieving equality, development and peace and that it violates and violates human rights and fundamental freedoms. The UN defines the phenomenon as a manifestation of power relations between women and men that, as history shows us, have always been unequal. Social media, it comes in a variety of forms from the most popular like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to things like blogs, business networks and forums. Those who are active online within these social media platforms each and every month reach into billions of users. Accessibility is also becoming easier, as everyone can now connect via a mobile device. The reason behind social media, why do people share? First, many want to share the content they find, because it is entertaining or the information has value. Social media helps connect people, as well as helping to grow businesses. Another reason includes people using social media for causes and charities, sharing these because they feel strongly about a certain issue. This brings us to how social media can have an impact on the community and general society. Many of the problems in the world today have more exposure, therefore bringing increased awareness of issues. This is definitely a positive side to social media, but is there also a downside?

When the pandemic forced a cessation of physical demonstrations in March, we employed a mixed-methods research design combining manual and automatic classification of tweets with qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interviews, in order to illuminate both how the independence movement responded to the pandemic in organizational and strategic terms, as well as providing a reflection of how activists reflected on the purposes and context of their activities. We conceptualise the cessation of activities as a period of 'abeyance' and ask how Scottish independence activists worked to stay mobilized during lockdowns. We found that the movement utilized a variety of strategies, including online events, and by framing independence as a response to these crises. In pointing to the mishandling of the pandemic by the Conservative government in Westminster, and the oncoming end of the Brexit transition period, for example, activists were able to emphasise the importance and urgency of the movement's cause.

This article uses the controversy, an instance ""YouTube drama,"" as an opportunity to investigate the ways in which an imagined ""atheist community"" is constructed through internal atheist conflict. Through critical discourse analysis of 157 YouTube videos, published between the end of March and the end of November, it identifies six different discursive formations, which affected the development of the drama and offer competing conceptions of the community. By utilizing Michael Warner's theory of 'publics' and tounterpublics,' spaces that exists only for the circulation of discourse, this study approaches the drama not as an interpersonal conflict, but as a battle over the norms of discourse within the atheist community. It suggests that a public lens is useful for understanding contemporary atheism, and that the nature of publics and counterpublics helps explain the dynamics of atheist disagreement on social issues.",YouTube; drama; RELIGION; atheism; publics; transphobia,WOS,,,,,,,,

We argue that online aggression toward women aims to reinforce traditional feminine norms and stereotypes. In a mixed methods study, we find that this type of aggression on Twitter is common and extensive and that it can spread far beyond the original target. We locate over 2.9 million tweets in one week that contain instances of gendered insults (e.g., ""bitch,"" ""cunt,"" ""slut,"" or ""whore"")—averaging 419,000 sexist slurs per day. The vast majority of these tweets are negative in sentiment. We analyze the social networks of the conversations that ensue in several cases and demonstrate how the use of ""replies,"" ""retweets,"" and ""likes"" can further victimize a target. Additionally, we develop a sentiment classifier that we use in a regression analysis to compare the negativity of sexist messages. We find that words in a message that reinforce feminine stereotypes inflate the negative sentiment of tweets to a significant and sizeable degree. These terms include those insulting someone's appearance (e.g., ""ugly""), intellect (e.g., ""stupid""), sexual experience (e.g., ""promiscuous""), mental stability (e.g., ""crazy""), and age (""old""). Messages enforcing beauty norms tend to be particularly negative. In sum, hostile, sexist tweets are strategic in nature. They aim to promote traditional, cultural beliefs about femininity, such as beauty ideals, and they shame victims by accusing them of falling short of these standards.

The first finding is that the phrase is used more often by male tweeters than by female tweeters. The second, as predicted by the literature on homophobia, is that the phrase is used in a negative emotional context to convey disapproval for men's homosexuality or behavior that is not gender normative. The third finding is that the modal use of the phrase ""no homo"" is in a positive emotional context, accompanying expressions of men's pleasure, desire, affection, attachment, and friendship. Our analysis suggests that the phrase ""no homo"" is a gendered one, primarily used by men to facilitate a particularly masculinized construction of positive emotional expression.

Selfies display their subject's face or body to social media followers and friends, making them particularly appearance-oriented images. As with other social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, Instagram posts garner feedback in the form of ""likes"" and comments from online audiences. When applied to selfies, such feedback can be interpreted as aggregated evaluations of their subject's physical appearance. We employ objectification theory to explore how value placed on selfie feedback among young women relates to markers of body image disturbance, including body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and bulimia action tendencies. We conducted an online survey of 177 English-speaking young adult (18–30 years-old) female Instagram users who were recruited through MTurk and who post selfies to examine the relationship between investment in selfie feedback and body image disturbance. We found that women who reported higher investment in selfie feedback were more likely to express body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness through the indirect influence of body surveillance, but this effect did not extend to bulimic tendencies. Our findings suggest that young adult female Instagram users who value audience responses to their selfies are more likely to exhibit disordered eating attitudes and intentions.

As a perspective, dis/ability destabilizes notions of normativity and enables an inquiry into not just marginalized identities, but also dominant identities. The analysis of blog posts, tweets and online press reviews of the first series of the British, Flemish and Dutch version of ‘The Undateables’ provides more insights into hegemonic and resistant notions on disability, dating and romantic relationships.

The programme, which exclusively focuses on dates of disabled people, was launched in the UK in 2012, and local adaptations of the format were broadcast in Belgium and the Netherlands. The article applies the dis/ability approach of Goodley and Runswick-Cole (2014) to examine the way in which representations of disabled singles are evaluated online. As a perspective, dis/ability destabilizes notions of normativity and enables an inquiry into not just marginalized identities, but also dominant identities. The analysis of blog posts, tweets and online press reviews of the first series of the British, Flemish and Dutch version of The Undateables' provides more insights into hegemonic and resistant notions on disability, dating and romantic relationships. This article argues that prejudices, as already identified by Morris in 1991, are still very dominant today.",disability; representation; Dating; mediated public debate; reality television; romantic relationships; DISABILITY; SEXUALITY,WOS,,,,,,,,

Triangulation methodology is used in this paper. Semi-structured interviews were performed with the administrators of LGBTI movement communities' Facebook and Twitter pages, an online questionnaire was made with the page followers, and a non-reactive observation was made concerning SNS posts of the pages during Pride Week, which is the most important annual public sphere event of the movement. Communication practices that SNS provide to the LGBTI movement groups and use of these practices are interpreted and analyzed through collected data. This study has shown that the LGBTI movement in Turkey uses SNS as a space of action effectively with collective action, centralizes SNS with their actions and moves the new social movements' features to the Internet as a way of enhancing its exposure in the public sphere.

This paper discusses technologies developed to measure the 'toxicity' of text-based content. The research builds upon queer linguistic studies that have indicated the use of 'mock impoliteness' as a form of interaction employed by LGBTQ people to cope with hostility. Automated analyses that disregard such a pro-social function may, contrary to their intended design, actually reinforce harmful biases. This paper uses 'Perspective', an AI technology developed by Jigsaw (formerly Google Ideas), to measure the levels of toxicity of tweets from prominent drag queens in the United States. The research indicated that Perspective considered a significant number of drag queen Twitter accounts to have higher levels of toxicity than white nationalists. The qualitative analysis revealed that Perspective was not able to properly consider social context when measuring toxicity levels and failed to recognize cases in which words, that might conventionally be seen as offensive, conveyed different meanings in LGBTQ speech.

The construct validity and applicability vary vastly among these scales. This paper introduces, therefore, a new index for measuring individual pornographic interests and underpins the literature of pornography. It also defines the necessary procedures required for compiling a dynamic lexicon of pornography, based on linguistic, cognitive and ontological facets, to allow for the development and evaluation of an Individual Pornographic Index (IPI). Such an index is ushered to replace the fidelity of a speaker (patient/applicant) by the fidelity of the spoken/written discourse (e.g., tweets and posts). WordNet and FrameNet are used to introduce all the semantically-related content words; boosting the selectional restrictions. Web-based exploration of online writings and database is also enabled to fetch the pertinent colloquial and slang pornographic lexical entries. Having compiling such a set of data, a working definition of 'pornography' is suggested. Results suggest that computational linguistics can be useful in measuring pornographic indices of individual written discourses. Moreover, WordNet's definition of pornography needs to be revisited and so do its ontolexical relations. Interoperability between Web, WordNet and FrameNet is fruitful in enriching the ontolexical seeds of this introduced lexicon and in suggesting several missing frames in FrameNet. More important, the proposed IPI can interestingly help psychiatrists assess the (hyper)sexuality status of individuals through their free writings.

What do feminists do in a global moment when antifeminist backlash emerges with fervor in politics, policy, and social spaces to reverse and challenge feminist progress? Rage happens. This article explores the role of rage in the development of African feminist digital counterpublics on Twitter. Through two Twitter hashtags, #MenAreTrash and #JusticeForSharon, I illuminate how anger emanating from increasing rates of femicide in Kenya and South Africa catalyzes the evolution of feminist communities of knowledge, solidarity, and resistance on Twitter. The rage illustrated in this article is considered in relation to longer histories of burnout and fatigue with nonresponse from the state and from male allies. Through these digital spaces, a process of building alliances and challenging antifeminist movements emerges. Feminist engagements around these hashtags are a site of concrete resistance against online misogyny as well as its material manifestations through femicide. In a context where antifeminist movements see digital spaces as sites to mobilize antifeminist sentiment, paying attention to digital feminist counterpublics is critical to understanding gender justice and freedom.

Specifically, we are interested in on- and offline activism that challenges norms of gendered violence and is led by young feminists. These protests were among those that received the widest media coverage in 2015 and 2016, shaping public discourse against sexual violence in South Africa. We focus here on three protests that included the use of Twitter hashtags—#RapeAtAzania, #RUReferencelist, and #RememberKhwezi—indicating a new reliance among young, educated feminists on social media for organizational, informational, and activist purposes. Using media articles and Twitter posts related to these hashtags, we analyze the ways and means through which some young feminists speak out against sexual violence in South Africa today. We ask how these new types of actions might interact with existing antiviolence and feminist movements in South Africa. Although sexual violence has long plagued South African society, young feminists today are engaging and identifying with this highly politicized issue on personal grounds. Via social media they reveal their own encounters with sexual violence, expose silences that accompany rape, and call for an ""unforgetting"" of the stories of rape survivors.

The event caught the imagination of XR protesters worldwide, with a video of the action being watched over one million times on Twitter. On 6 December that year a 'Global Discobedience' event was held where the protest was reproduced in over 20 countries on the same day. This paper will present an exploratory examination of why the Discobedience has struck such a chord and become so popular within the movement, using the event as a lens through which to explore the possibilities offered by the mode of protesting it represents. It will use the concept of 'bad environmentalism', as developed by Nicole Seymour, to frame the action as one that offers a potential destabilisation and queering of time and makes thinking differently about the future possible in new ways. It will argue that the musical choice of 'Stayin' Alive', and the cultural memories it evokes, are central to this possibility.

A salient finding was that more journalists perceived PR more neutrally or positively than previously. The results suggest a need for systematic and continual efforts to deliver an accurate picture of PR geared to media journalists.

Prior research demonstrates that violent repression can either decrease protest participation through raising the costs of participation, or can generate outrage, resulting in ""backfire"" and an increase in mobilization. Many recent mass mobilizations have garnered attention from scholars and journalists alike due to the instances of repression backfiring as well as the widespread use of social media in these protest movements. We examine why these two trends may be related using logistic regression analysis on data on participants in the Gezi Park Protests in summer 2013. Controlling for confounding factors, we find a statistically significant relationship between being recruited to participate in the protests through social media and joining the mass mobilization as a reaction to police repression. We argue that in the case of Gezi Park, communication through social media was a key factor in facilitating social movement mobilization in response to repression.",social media; mobilization; repression; backfire; collective behavior and social movements,WOS,,,,,,,,

In detail, it consists of eight dimensions that describe three different areas: personal well-being, social well-being and well-being at work. The Italian subjective well-being index ( SWBI ITA ), that we display here, audits the Italian subjective well-being revealed by tweets acquired via the public Twitter API, written in the Italian language, and posted from Italy from January 2012 to December 2017. Around 1–5% of the data includes geo-referenced information, which allows us to provide an index at local level. The Twitter data analysis is carried on with a human supervised sentiment analysis method, the Integrated Sentiment Analysis (iSA) algorithm. In this work, after a weighting procedure adopted to partially overcome the selection bias caused by the use of data from social network, we describe the SWBI ITA dimensions in the considered period at the regional level.

Dynamic and multi-dimensional characteristics of QoL ask for new data sources to update the relevant indicators and novel methods for QoL assessment. This research presents a comprehensive framework for assessing QoL in intra-national level. To address current challenges, the focus has been on integrating subjective and objective criteria, using the geotagged Tweets as user-generated geo-contents (UGGCs) to extract some subjective criteria, and utilizing a multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the cumulative belief degree (CBD) method to integrate and provide the final output. The proposed framework is implemented to assess the QoL in the provinces of Iran as the case study. Based on the obtained results, Tehran has a better QoL status, while Sistan-and-Balouchestan and Kermanshah have rather unsuitable conditions compared to other provinces. Results show the potential of the UGGCs to cover the dynamic characteristics of QoL and to complement the official data. Also, the functional capabilities of the CBD method in integrating heterogeneous criteria, handling uncertainty, and suitably providing the final results of QoL assessment in different scenarios allow authorities to get a more comprehensive, realistic view on QoL issues. The proposed method of this research is a step toward an integrated assessment of QoL using the data shared by people in the location-based social networks which could be regarded as a novel and useful tool for administrators in the field of QoL.

Due to its great accessibility to data, Twitter constitutes a convenient data source to monitor and evaluate a wide variety of topics. In addition, Twitter's marked orientation towards news and the dissemination of information makes this microblogging network more connected to politics compared to other platforms. Through static and dynamic topic modelling techniques, we were able to identify the topics that have attracted the most attention from Twitters users and to characterise their temporal evolution.

First, we hypothesize that citizens who consume their news predominately from social media will have higher perceptions of political corruption than consumers of more traditional media sources. Second, we hypothesize that perceptions among social media consumers will be more polarized. Specifically, we argue that the gap in corruption perception between supporters of government and opposition political parties will be larger among social media consumers compared to traditional news consumers. We test our hypotheses using newly collected survey data from the European Quality of Government Index survey from 2017, which contains nearly 78,000 respondents in 21 countries in the European Union.

These psychological characteristics may be studied unobtrusively through the use of text analysis, which is especially valuable when it comes to investigating the characteristics of political elites, who are otherwise extremely difficult to study, despite their importance for understanding ideological dynamics. In the present research program we used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to analyze the language used by 279–388 members of the U.S. Congress on Twitter (n = 88,874 tweets), Facebook (n = 15,636 posts), and the floor of Congress (n = 6,159 speeches) over the same four-month period (February 9–May 28, 2014). Consistent with findings based on ordinary citizens, we observed that conservative legislators used more language pertaining to religion, power, threat, inhibition, risk and – on the floor of Congress – tradition and resistance to change. Conversely, liberal legislators used more language pertaining to affiliation, achievement, benevolence, emotion in general, 'social' concerns and – on the floor of Congress – universalism, stimulation, and hedonism. Implications for the study of political psycholinguistics focusing on ideological and contextual variability in communication patterns on various platforms are discussed, as are differences in language used by ordinary citizens and political elites.

How do supporters of the Movement for Black Lives and their opponents coordinate on Twitter? Drawing on a corpus of 18.5 million tweets, this paper compares coordination among supporters and opponents of #blacklivesmatter in terms of relations and spatialities. We elaborate two different models of coordination: the swarm and the grassroots. Compared to their adversaries, supporters of #blacklivesmatter are more strongly rooted in places and embedded in local relations, suggesting that their online activism builds on grassroots communities. Opponents can be differentiated into two categories. One group consists of conservatives that are rooted in places but in a markedly different geography than supporters; they are more often located outside of major cities and outside of the coastal states. A second group of digitally networked extreme right opponents coordinates more in the fashion of a swarm: they synchronize without being rooted in places or embedded in local relations. These findings demonstrate that movements and countermovements benefit from the affordances of social media in different ways.

This study explores protesters' accounts of their experiences. We examine these experiences using two lines of inquiry – how did the participants of the Gezi Park protests use linguistic cues when writing at the park and how did those writings differ from personal reflections posted on Twitter? Using a narrative inquiry framework, we employed significance analysis on short narratives written on sticky notes in the Gezi Park and a sample of tweets posted during the protests. Narrators of the sticky notes responded to two prompts: 'before the resistance' and 'after the resistance.' Results revealed that participants in the Park used low rates of cognitive and affective expressions, and negations in the after-narratives. The after-narratives were then compared with tweets posted on Twitter. Analysis of tweets showed higher rates of intensifiers and cognitive expressions, and notably less affective expressions than the after-narratives written on sticky notes. The differences in participants' accounts are discussed in relation to qualities of technologies individuals were using, social contexts, potential audiences, and the country's sociopolitical history.

The study argues that different interpretations of patriotism underpinned divergent evaluations of the conflict and the construction of opposing identities. An analysis of Twitter posts on the eve of the march shows that peace activists positioned themselves as citizens with high moral standards and a healthy dose of patriotism, criticized the Russian government for military intervention in Ukraine, and called for a peaceful conflict resolution. In turn, opponents of the march considered themselves as real patriots and their adversaries as national traitors, denied Russia's military presence in Ukraine, and fomented an attack on critics of Russian foreign policy. The study contributes to social movement literature by analyzing the framing of antiwar activism on a social media platform in the midst of a hybrid war, marked by a great deal of ambiguity and deception about causes, dynamics, and consequences of military operations by state and non-state actors.

In this study, we argue that such movements are ultimately ineffective because they struggle to sustain themselves over time and identify the reasons behind their transience. Our analysis focuses on Twitter conversations about Aadhaar, a biometric ID project that has raised concerns about data privacy and civil liberty in India, the world's largest democracy. A computational mixed-methods approach incorporating social network analysis, sentiment analysis, and structural topic modeling demonstrates that connective action against Aadhaar failed to produce a sustained discourse of resistance, with people's feelings toward and beliefs about Aadhaar vacillating sharply. The analysis draws attention to the power of brick-and-mortar social institutions, including the state and its agencies, political parties, courts, technology companies, and 'legacy' news media, in shaping and reshaping seemingly bottom-up discourses on digital platforms. It also identifies three interlinked weaknesses of connective action – the individualized nature of mobilization, excessive flexibility of social networks, and a negative emotional culture. We contend that in order to be effective, contemporary social movements need to utilize digital technologies for 'collective' action by forging collective identities that bind participants affectively and cognitively, empower them against structures of social control, and enable them to commit to non-personal and long-term objectives.

The #MeToo campaign was intense and brief. It was trending at the end of March 2019, but by mid-April interest in it had plummeted. This article examines how the hashtag depended on activists' efforts in order to build an affective community for disclosure of sexual harassment. Based on the voices of participants, this study argues that although activists were able to handle affective labor to solve collectively urgent problems arising within the campaign, they failed to withstand the backlash which followed the suicide of Armando Verga Gil, a famous rock musician, after being accused of sexual abuse online. From the perspective of social movements theory, #MeToo is characterized as digital direct action forming part of the repertoire of contention of feminist crowds.

Described by one of its co-creators as a call to collective action in the struggle against racial inequity, the movement's hashtag (#BlackLivesMatter) was second to only #Ferguson among the most frequently used racial justice hashtags in the first 10 years of Twitter's existence. This critical case study analyzes the reflective narratives of 14 self-identified White social media users – part of a larger, interracial group of self-identified online social actors – who used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag as part of their online activism repertoire during the height of the movement. Grounded by the application of Helms' White Racial Consciousness Development Scale, this research presents a descriptive account of the ways antiracist labor – colloquially described as 'White folks' work' – can be performed via social media. Using an a priori definition of allyship as the processes of affirming and taking informed action on behalf of the subjugated group, this research illustrates that strategic information seeking and sharing on Twitter – particularly the amplification of marginalized voices – were key components in the development of digital allyship praxis within this social-media-fueled movement for racial justice.

This interpretation requires a perspective different from that used for studying opposition demonstrations: instead of seeing the regime’s social media strategy for promoting counter-demonstrations as attempts to attract maximum involvement, the message should be judged on its capacity to discourage large-scale collective action. To show how this works in practice, the two biggest recent pro-regime counter-demonstrations are analysed: their context and background and the promotion of them on their official VKontakte pages and in related Twitter posts by prominent pro-regime tweeters. What may appear as strategies to mobilize for counter-demonstrations emerge as efforts to engender emotions that serve the regime’s purpose of keeping the population apolitical and passive.

Drawing on the work of Tarrow, this article considers the impact of cycle effects on the effectiveness of social media as a mobilising and organising tool for the 2010/11 U.K. student protests. Although preceding the broader ‘movement of the squares’ contention cycle, the protests made similar use of social media for generating mass participation. Yet, its mobilising power was dependent on a number of temporal factors, including amplification through mainstream media and the urgency of its initial campaign goal. Moreover, towards the end of the cycle, activists were found to be using social media – via ‘secret’ Facebook groups – in ways that reinforced emerging group hierarchies, arguably contradicting their initial commitment to open-access networks and participatory democracy.

To this aim, we propose a network-based approach to explore the changing role that these tools play during the dynamic unfolding of movement processes and, more particularly, over the course of their institutionalization. In the first part, we read the added value of social media as a function of the ‘integrative power’ of the networks they foster – a unique and evolving form of sociotechnical power that springs from the virtuous encounter between social media networking potential and social resources. In the second part, we investigate this form of power by focusing directly on online networks’ structure as well as on the type of communication and participation environments they host. We apply our proposed approach to the longitudinal exploration of the Twitter networks deployed in the period 2012–2014 during three annual editions of the transnational feminist campaign ‘Take Back The Tech!’ (TBTT). Results from our case study suggest that, over time, TBTT supporters do in fact make a differentiated use of social media affordances – progressively switching their communicative strategies to better sustain the campaign’s efforts inside and outside institutional venues. Thus, the exploration of the TBTT case provides evidence of the usefulness of the proposed approach to reflect on the different modes in which social media can be exploited in different mobilization stages and political terrains.

This article investigates media practices in the Occupy movement and develops the concept of social movement media cultures: the set of tools, skills, social practices and norms that movement participants deploy to create, circulate, curate and amplify movement media across all available platforms. The article posits three key areas of inquiry into social movement media cultures, and explores them through the lens of the Occupy movement: (1) What media platforms, tools and skills are used most widely by movement participants? (Practices); (2) What role do experienced practitioners play in movement media practices? (Expertise); and (3) In what ways does the movement media culture lean toward open or participatory, and in what ways toward closed or top–down? (Open/Closed). Insight into the media culture of the Occupy movement is based on mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, participant observation, visual research and participation in Occupy Hackathons, as well as the Occupy Research General Demographic and Political Participation Survey, a database of approximately 1200 local Occupy sites, and a dataset of more than 13 million Occupy-related tweets.

An analysis of Twitter posts on the eve of the march shows that peace activists positioned themselves as citizens with high moral standards and a healthy dose of patriotism, criticized the Russian government for military intervention in Ukraine, and called for a peaceful conflict resolution. In turn, opponents of the march considered themselves as real patriots and their adversaries as national traitors, denied Russia's military presence in Ukraine, and fomented an attack on critics of Russian foreign policy. The study contributes to social movement literature by analyzing the framing of antiwar activism on a social media platform in the midst of a hybrid war, marked by a great deal of ambiguity and deception about causes, dynamics, and consequences of military operations by state and non-state actors.",Russia; MOBILIZATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; social media; framing; PROTEST; Antiwar protests; CENSORSHIP; hybrid war; MOVEMENT; peace march; RESOURCES; SUPPORT; WARFARE,WOS,,,,,,,,

This study explores protesters' accounts of their experiences. We examine these experiences using two lines of inquiry - how did the participants of the Gezi Park protests use linguistic cues when writing at the park and how did those writings differ from personal reflections posted on Twitter? Using a narrative inquiry framework, we employed significance analysis on short narratives written on sticky notes in the Gezi Park and a sample of tweets posted during the protests. Narrators of the sticky notes responded to two prompts: 'before the resistance' and 'after the resistance.' Results revealed that participants in the Park used low rates of cognitive and affective expressions, and negations in the after-narratives. The after-narratives were then compared with tweets posted on Twitter. Analysis of tweets showed higher rates of intensifiers and cognitive expressions, and notably less affective expressions than the after-narratives written on sticky notes. The differences in participants' accounts are discussed in relation to qualities of technologies individuals were using, social contexts, potential audiences, and the country's sociopolitical history.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Twitter; COLLECTIVE ACTION; EMOTIONS; EMPOWERMENT; TOOL; Gezi Park; IDENTITIES; collective action; narrative inquiry; Political protest; writing; NARRATIVES; CONTEXT; TWITTER USE; SMALL STORIES,WOS,,,,,,,,

This critical case study analyzes the reflective narratives of 14 self-identified White social media users - part of a larger, interracial group of self-identified online social actors - who used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag as part of their online activism repertoire during the height of the movement. Grounded by the application of Helms' White Racial Consciousness Development Scale, this research presents a descriptive account of the ways antiracist labor - colloquially described as 'White folks' work' - can be performed via social media. Using an a priori definition of allyship as the processes of affirming and taking informed action on behalf of the subjugated group, this research illustrates that strategic information seeking and sharing on Twitter - particularly the amplification of marginalized voices - were key components in the development of digital allyship praxis within this social-media-fueled movement for racial justice.",Twitter; social media; IDENTITY; hashtag activism; RACE; RACISM; Black Lives Matter; racial justice; white allies; ALLIES; BLACK; PRIVILEGE,WOS,,,,,,,,

While authors have extolled the virtues of Facebook and Twitter as organisational and informational tools for a range of movements from the Arab Spring to Occupy, evidence remains patchy as to under what conditions social media is most effective at engaging and mobilising the wider public. Drawing on the work of Tarrow, this article considers the impact of cycle effects on the effectiveness of social media as a mobilising and organising tool for the 2010/11 U.K. student protests. Although preceding the broader 'movement of the squares' contention cycle, the protests made similar use of social media for generating mass participation. Yet, its mobilising power was dependent on a number of temporal factors, including amplification through mainstream media and the urgency of its initial campaign goal. Moreover, towards the end of the cycle, activists were found to be using social media - via 'secret' Facebook groups - in ways that reinforced emerging group hierarchies, arguably contradicting their initial commitment to open-access networks and participatory democracy.",Social media; ONLINE; Twitter; IDENTITY; Facebook; collective identity; mobilisation; protest cycle; student activism; SOLIDARITY,WOS,,,,,,,,

This interpretation requires a perspective different from that used for studying opposition demonstrations: instead of seeing the regime's social media strategy for promoting counter-demonstrations as attempts to attract maximum involvement, the message should be judged on its capacity to discourage large-scale collective action. To show how this works in practice, the two biggest recent pro-regime counter-demonstrations are analysed: their context and background and the promotion of them on their official VKontakte pages and in related Twitter posts by prominent pro-regime tweeters. What may appear as strategies to mobilize for counter-demonstrations emerge as efforts to engender emotions that serve the regime's purpose of keeping the population apolitical and passive.",Russia; POLITICS; social media; mobilization; emotions; authoritarianism; demonstrations; RUSSIA,WOS,,,,,,,,

In this study, we argue that such movements are ultimately ineffective because they struggle to sustain themselves over time and identify the reasons behind their transience. Our analysis focuses on Twitter conversations about Aadhaar, a biometric ID project that has raised concerns about data privacy and civil liberty in India, the world's largest democracy. A computational mixed-methods approach incorporating social network analysis, sentiment analysis, and structural topic modeling demonstrates that connective action against Aadhaar failed to produce a sustained discourse of resistance, with people's feelings toward and beliefs about Aadhaar vacillating sharply. The analysis draws attention to the power of brick-and-mortar social institutions, including the state and its agencies, political parties, courts, technology companies, and 'legacy' news media, in shaping and reshaping seemingly bottom-up discourses on digital platforms. It also identifies three interlinked weaknesses of connective action - the individualized nature of mobilization, excessive flexibility of social networks, and a negative emotional culture. We contend that in order to be effective, contemporary social movements need to utilize digital technologies for 'collective' action by forging collective identities that bind participants affectively and cognitively, empower them against structures of social control, and enable them to commit to non-personal and long-term objectives.",MOBILIZATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; sentiment analysis; Twitter; IDENTITY; PROTEST; topic modeling; social movement; emotion; MOVEMENTS; PRIVACY; influencer,WOS,,,,,,,,

The #MeToo campaign was intense and brief. It was trending at the end of March 2019, but by mid-April interest in it had plummeted. This article examines how the hashtag depended on activists' efforts in order to build an affective community for disclosure of sexual harassment. Based on the voices of participants, this study argues that although activists were able to handle affective labor to solve collectively urgent problems arising within the campaign, they failed to withstand the backlash which followed the suicide of Armando Verga Gil, a famous rock musician, after being accused of sexual abuse online.

To this aim, we propose a network-based approach to explore the changing role that these tools play during the dynamic unfolding of movement processes and, more particularly, over the course of their institutionalization. In the first part, we read the added value of social media as a function of the 'integrative power' of the networks they foster - a unique and evolving form of sociotechnical power that springs from the virtuous encounter between social media networking potential and social resources. In the second part, we investigate this form of power by focusing directly on online networks' structure as well as on the type of communication and participation environments they host. We apply our proposed approach to the longitudinal exploration of the Twitter networks deployed in the period 2012-2014 during three annual editions of the transnational feminist campaign 'Take Back The Tech!' (TBTT). Results from our case study suggest that, over time, TBTT supporters do in fact make a differentiated use of social media affordances - progressively switching their communicative strategies to better sustain the campaign's efforts inside and outside institutional venues. Thus, the exploration of the TBTT case provides evidence of the usefulness of the proposed approach to reflect on the different modes in which social media can be exploited in different mobilization stages and political terrains.",Social media; social network analysis; DYNAMICS; institutionalization; integrative power; online collective action networks; sociotechnicality,WOS,,,,,,,,

These regimes involve particular 'speeds' -the rate at which media content is renewed - as well as 'temporal orientations' towards present, past, and future. The article questions how specific temporal regimes enable or complicate protestors' efforts to gain public legitimacy. A large body of research suggests that it is difficult to gain such legitimacy in the mainstream news cycle, in which protest is primarily covered from an 'episodic' perspective, ignoring larger protest issues. The present analysis suggests that despite the participatory affordances of social media, it has not become any easier to generate sustained public attention for structural protest issues. Drawing examples from three case studies, it demonstrates that the dominant mode of social media protest communication reproduces and reinforces the episodic focus of the mainstream news. While other temporal perspectives on protest are certainly developed in the alternative and mainstream news, as well as in activist social media communication, these do not fundamentally challenge the prevailing temporal orientation towards the present, towards the event.",POLITICS; social media; JOURNALISTS; protest; COMMUNICATION; COVERAGE; Temporality; alternative media; TWITTER; OCCUPY MOVEMENT; 24-hour news cycle; DISSENT,WOS,,,,,,,,

Results show that three typologically distinct activist roles emerged during the protests: local activists, digital movement intellectuals and digital distributors. These different types of actors were involved in four different forms of social media use: mobilization, construction of the physical space, extension of the local and augmentation of local and translocal bonds. Based on our findings, we argue that the coming together of these different activist roles and the different uses of social media added a translocal dimension to the peripheral and physically remote political conflict in Kallak.

The results are consistent with classical diffusion models positing that specialized information comes with greater centralization, but they also show that users favor decentralized formations, which can foster community cohesion, when spreading specialized information is secondary.

We characterize this property by means of a quantitative analysis of the structural and dynamical patterns emergent from human interactions, and show it to be universal across several Twitter conversations. We found that some influential users efficiently cause remarkable collective reactions by each message sent, while the majority of users must employ extremely larger efforts to reach similar effects. Next we propose a model that reproduces the retweet cascades occurring on Twitter to explain the emergent distribution of the user efficiency. The model shows that the dynamical patterns of the conversations are strongly conditioned by the topology of the underlying network. We conclude that the appearance of a small fraction of extremely efficient users results from the heterogeneity of the followers network and independently of the individual user behavior.

Since an increasing amount of political communication now occurs online, data from online interactions may offer a new toolkit to study ties between politicians; however, the methods by which robust insights can be derived from online data require further development, especially around the dynamics of political social networks. We develop a novel method for tracking the evolution of community structures, referred to as ‘multiplex community affiliation clustering’ (MCAC), and use it to study the online social networks of Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the United Kingdom. Social interaction networks are derived from social media (Twitter) communication over an eventful 17-month period spanning the UK General Election in 2015 and the UK Referendum on membership of the European Union in 2016. We find that the social network structure linking MPs and MEPs evolves over time, with distinct communities forming and re-forming, driven by party affiliations and political events. Without including any information about time in our model, we nevertheless find that the evolving social network structure shows multiple persistent and recurring states of affiliation between politicians, which align with content states derived from topic analysis of tweet text. These findings show that the dominant state of partisan segregation can be challenged by major political events, ideology, and intra-party tension that transcend party affiliations.

Abstract Many social phenomena can be modeled as cascades in networks, where nodes adopt a behavior in response to peers adopting. When studying cascades, researchers typically assume that the number of active peers when a node adopts is equivalent to the node's threshold for adoption. This assumption is rarely justified due to the ""opacity problem"": networked cascades reveal intervals which contain thresholds, rather than point estimates. Existing approaches take the maximum of each node's threshold interval, which biases models of social influence. Opacity is inevitable in many small graphs when using the threshold model, resulting from the networked process itself rather than data collection techniques. Using simulation, we extend this finding to the probabilistic SI (independent cascade) model. We confirm these theoretical results by studying 50 large hashtag cascades among 3.2 million Twitter users, finding that 20% of adoptions suffer from opacity. Different assumptions in response to opacity qualitatively change conclusions about peer influence. While opacity is a far-reaching problem, it can be addressed. Using information from nodes who have tightly bounded intervals allows building models to reduce error in estimating node thresholds.

We examine a community of Twitter users over a five month period, operationalizing social contagion as ‘retweeting’, and social structure as the count of subgraphs (small patterns of ties and nodes) between users in the follower/following network. We find that popular individuals act as ‘inefficient hubs’ for social contagion: they have limited attention, are overloaded with inputs, and therefore display limited responsiveness to viral messages. We argue this contradicts the ‘law of the few’ and ‘influentials hypothesis’. We find that community structures, particularly reciprocal ties and certain triadic structures, substantially increase social contagion. This contradicts the theory that communities display lower internal contagion because of the inherent redundancy and lack of novelty of messages within a community. Instead, we speculate that the reasons community structures show increased social contagion are, first, that members of communities have higher similarity (reflecting shared interests and characteristics, increasing the relevance of messages), and second, that communities amplify the social bonding effect of retransmitted messages.

In this work we define efficiency on Twitter, as the ratio between the emergent spreading process and the activity employed by the user. We characterize this property by means of a quantitative analysis of the structural and dynamical patterns emergent from human interactions, and show it to be universal across several Twitter conversations. We found that some influential users efficiently cause remarkable collective reactions by each message sent, while the majority of users must employ extremely larger efforts to reach similar effects. Next we propose a model that reproduces the retweet cascades occurring on Twitter to explain the emergent distribution of the user efficiency. The model shows that the dynamical patterns of the conversations are strongly conditioned by the topology of the underlying network. We conclude that the appearance of a small fraction of extremely efficient users results from the heterogeneity of the followers network and independently of the individual user behavior.

The results are consistent with classical diffusion models positing that specialized information comes with greater centralization, but they also show that users favor decentralized formations, which can foster community cohesion, when spreading specialized information is secondary.

We explore the internal structure of these networks to determine whether they have the same kind of layered structure as has been found in offline face-to-face networks (which have a distinctively scaled structure with successively inclusive layers at 5, 15,50 and 150 alters). The two Facebook datasets are best described by a four-layer structure and the Twitter dataset by a five-layer structure. The absolute sizes of these layers and the mean frequencies of contact with alters within each layer match very closely the observed values from offline networks. In addition, all three datasets reveal the existence of an innermost network layer at similar to 1.5 alters. Our analyses thus confirm the existence of the layered structure of ego-centric social networks with a very much larger sample (in total, >185,000 egos) than those previously used to describe them, as well as identifying the existence of an additional network layer whose existence was only hypothesised in offline social networks.

Since an increasing amount of political communication now occurs online, data from online interactions may offer a new toolkit to study ties between politicians; however, the methods by which robust insights can be derived from online data require further development, especially around the dynamics of political social networks. We develop a novel method for tracking the evolution of community structures, referred to as 'multiplex community affiliation clustering' (MCAC), and use it to study the online social networks of Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the United Kingdom. Social interaction networks are derived from social media (Twitter) communication over an eventful 17-month period spanning the UK General Election in 2015 and the UK Referendum on membership of the European Union in 2016. We find that the social network structure linking MPs and MEPs evolves over time, with distinct communities forming and re-forming, driven by party affiliations and political events. Without including any information about time in our model, we nevertheless find that the evolving social network structure shows multiple persistent and recurring states of affiliation between politicians, which align with content states derived from topic analysis of tweet text. These findings show that the dominant state of partisan segregation can be challenged by major political events, ideology, and intra-party tension that transcend party affiliations.

Students in the control group did not receive a training of SRL skills and simply used Twitter as it was. After the training session, students in both groups worked on their class projects and used Twitter where students interacted with each other. Using a content analysis, student posts or “tweets” on Twitter were analyzed.

We argue that there also is utility in studying how configurations of four actors, or tetrads, pattern our social world. The current project considers the prevalence of directed tetrads across twenty social networks representing five relationship types (friendship, legislative co-sponsorship, Twitter, advice seeking, and email). By comparing these observed networks to randomly generated conditional networks, we identify tetrads that occur more frequently than expected, or network motifs. In all twenty networks, we find evidence for six tetrad motifs that collectively highlight tendencies toward hierarchy, clustering, and bridging in social interaction. Variations across network genres also emerge, suggesting that unique tetrad structural signatures could define different types of interaction.

However, the underlying process by which celebrity status and media coverage leads to increases in subsequent suicides is still unclear. This study collected over 1 million individual messages (“tweets”) posted on Twitter that were related to 26 prominent figures in Japan who died by suicide between 2010 and 2014 and investigated whether media reports on suicide deaths that generated a greater level of reactions by the public are likely to be followed by a larger increase in actual suicides. We also compared the number of Twitter posts and the number of media reports in newspaper and on television to understand whether the number of messages on Twitter in response to the deaths corresponds to the amount of coverage in the traditional media. Using daily data from Japan's national death registry between 2010 and 2014, our analysis found an increase in actual suicides only when suicide deaths generated a large reaction from Twitter users. In contrast, no discernible increase in suicide counts was observed when the analysis included suicide deaths to which Twitter users did not show much interest, even when these deaths were covered considerably by the traditional media. This study also found suicides by relatively young entertainers generated a large number of posts on Twitter. This sharply contrasts with the relatively smaller volume of reaction to them generated by traditional forms of media, which focuses more on the deaths of non-entertainers. The results of this study strongly suggest that it is not sufficient to examine only traditional news media when investigating the impact of media reports on actual suicides.

However, it remains unclear why, or by what exact mechanism, celebrity suicides act to increase suicidal risk in the wider public due to the lack of data showing how the public understands and reacts to the suicide of well-known figures. This study used a supervised machine learning approach to investigate the emotional content of almost 1 million messages sent on Twitter related to the suicides of 18 prominent individuals in Japan between 2010 and 2014. The results revealed that different demographic characteristics of the deceased person (age, gender, and occupation) resulted in significant differences in emotional response; notably that the suicides of younger people, of women and of people in entertainment careers created more emotional responses (measured as a ratio of emotionally-coded tweets within the overall volume of tweets for each case) than for older people, men, and those in other careers. Moreover, certain types of emotional response were shown to correlate to subsequent rises in the national suicide counts, with ""surprised"" reactions being positively correlated with the suicide counts, while a high proportion of polite messages of condolence were negatively correlated. The study demonstrates the importance of, and describes a methodology for, considering the content of social media messages, not just their volume, in research into the mechanism by which these widely-reported deaths increase suicide risk in the broader public.

A total of 549,972 tweets were downloaded and coded for the presence of anti-vaccine beliefs through a machine learning algorithm. Tweets with self-disclosed geographic information were resolved and United States Census data were collected for corresponding areas at the micropolitan/metropolitan level. Trends in number of anti-vaccine tweets were examined at the national and state levels over time. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used to determine census variables that were correlated with anti-vaccination tweet volume. Fifty percent of our sample of 549,972 tweets collected between 2009 and 2015 contained anti-vaccine beliefs. Anti-vaccine tweet volume increased after vaccine-related news coverage. California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania had anti-vaccination tweet volume that deviated from the national average. Demographic characteristics explained 67% of variance in geographic clustering of anti-vaccine tweets, which were associated with a larger population and higher concentrations of women who recently gave birth, households with high income levels, men aged 40 to 44, and men with minimal college education. Monitoring anti-vaccination beliefs on Twitter can uncover vaccine-related concerns and misconceptions, serve as an indicator of shifts in public opinion, and equip pediatricians to refute anti-vaccine arguments. Real-time interventions are needed to counter anti-vaccination beliefs online. Identifying clusters of anti-vaccination beliefs can help public health professionals disseminate targeted/tailored interventions to geographic locations and demographic sectors of the population.

This study thereby examined how national health departments deployed persuasive strategies to promote citizen engagement in COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets in six countries, including the UK, the US, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and India. Guided by the heuristic-systematic model and the health belief model, we found that national health departments differed significantly in the use of systematic-heuristic cues and health belief constructs in COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets. Generally, the provision of scientific information and appeals to anecdotes and fear positively, while appeals to bandwagon negatively, predicted citizen engagement. Messages about overcoming barriers and promoting vaccine benefits and self-efficacy positively affected engagement. Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate demonstrated negative impacts. Importantly, health departments across countries often used futile or detrimental strategies in tweets. A locally adapted evidence-based approach for COVID-19 vaccination persuasion was discussed. • Health departments often used detrimental tactics in promoting COVID-19 vaccines. • Appeals to facts, anecdotes, and fear promoted citizen engagement. • Appeals to bandwagon reduced citizen engagement. • Messages about efficacies and benefits promoted citizen engagement. • Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate harmed citizen engagement.

As BLM gained momentum, counter-movements emerged, such as All Lives Matter (ALM), White Lives Matter (WLM), and Blue Lives Matter (BlueLM). Because they undermine support for Black people's safety and culture, exposure to stances against BLM can be a race-related stressor. Although the perception of racial discrimination has been associated with negative health outcomes in Black people, it is not clear whether exposure to negative stances on a race-related social issue is associated with worse health outcomes. We investigated whether living in areas of the United States with a high prevalence of negative stances on BLM is associated with worse health outcomes, such as higher body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of obesity. We scraped geo-coded tweets (N = 51,020) that contained #BLM, #ALM, #WLM, and #BlueLM from 2014 to 2016. We determined the stances of the tweets on BLM using machine learning algorithms and aggregated stances at the metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area (MMSA) levels. Participants' BMI and obesity status were derived from the 2017 BRFSS SMART data in 76 MMSAs, as compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (N = 20,530). After controlling for individual- and regional-level covariates, regional measures of racism and police brutality rate, and baseline BMI in 2014 aggregated on MMSA level, Black people had a higher BMI and prevalence of obesity in areas that showed higher negative stances on BLM. Stances against BLM were positively associated with implicit racism against Black people and can be an acute race-related stressor associated with negative downstream health outcomes. Negative societal sentiments around race-related issues may be detrimental to the health outcomes of minority populations. • Stances on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement captured through Twitter data. • Stances against BLM associated with higher BMI and prevalence of obesity for Blacks. • Stances against BLM associated with higher level of implicit racism against Blacks. • Negative stances on race-related issues can be detrimental to minorities' health.

Using comprehensive six-year data sets of Twitter posts and suicide deaths in Japan, we examine the diurnal relationship between the proportional incidence of a suicide-related keyword, ""kietai"" (""I want to disappear""), and suicide deaths with an OLS regression model. We also use co-occurrence analysis to reveal changes in the linguistic context of the suicide-related keyword at different hours of the day. We find a clear diurnal pattern in the use of this suicide-related keyword, peaking between 1am and 5am. This diurnal trend is positively correlated with suicide deaths among younger cohorts (ages 15 to 44), but the correlation is negative among older adults (45 and over). The correlation among young adults strengthens when a delay between tweet incidence and suicide deaths is included. Compared to daytime tweets, nighttime tweets exhibited a stronger relationship between words related to self-disgust and words directly indicating suicidal intent. This study confirms the hypothesised link between online suicidal ideation and suicide death. Despite frequent flippant use of the keyword, the consistent correlation and the diurnal changes in the context of the keyword's usage demonstrate the value of social media data to the study of mental health trends in groups at risk of suicide. • Uses Twitter data to confirm a link between online suicidal ideation and suicide. • Shows a correlation between suicide deaths and usage of a suicide-related keyword. • A positive correlation is found for suicides by people aged under 45 in Japan. • Allowing a time lag for preparation or travel strengthens the correlation. • Text analysis relates the keyword more closely to ""self-disgust"" at night.

An important contributor to LGBT health disparities is the inequitable or substandard care that LGBT individuals receive from hospitals. Objective To investigate inequities in hospital care among LGBT patients using the popular social media platform Twitter. Method This study examined a dataset of Twitter communications (tweets) collected from February 2015 to May 2017. The tweets mentioned Twitter handles for hospitals (i.e., usernames for hospitals) and LGBT related terms. The topics discussed were explored to develop an LGBT position index referring to whether the hospital appears supportive or not supportive of LGBT rights. Results for each hospital were then compared to the Healthcare Equality Index (HEI), an established index to evaluate equity of hospital care towards LGBT patients. Results In total, 1856 tweets mentioned LGBT terms representing 653 unique hospitals. Of these hospitals, 189 (28.9%) were identified as HEI leaders. Hospitals in the Northeast showed significantly greater support towards LGBT issues compared to hospitals in the Midwest. Hospitals deemed as HEI leaders had higher LGBT position scores compared to non-HEI leaders (p = 0.042), when controlling for hospital size and location. Conclusions This exploratory study describes a novel approach to monitoring LGBT hospital care. While these initial findings should be interpreted cautiously, they can potentially inform practices to improve equity of care and efforts to address health disparities among gender minority groups. Highlights • Our study describes a novel approach for monitoring LGBT hospital care. • Twitter may be feasible for exploring inequities in hospital care in LGBT patients. • Twitter data appear consistent with the annual Healthcare Equality Index report. • Demonstrates potential to understand health disparities using social media. • Can inform efforts to improve equity of care among gender minority groups.

Today, mental illness is the leading cause of total years lived with disability. At the same time, global mental health policies and budgets fall short of addressing the societal burden as mental health discourse languishes in the shadows due to stigma. As social media have become an increasingly popular source of information, they create opportunities as well as threats for mental health discourse. On the one hand, social media can help to bring awareness to stigmatized topics as they give marginalized members of society the possibility to share experiences and voice their discontent. On the other hand, mental health discourse on social media may lead to stigmatization. To date, little is known about social media mental health discourse and what drives it. This study addresses these research gaps by (1) mapping the mental health discourse on Twitter and (2) analyzing mechanisms of cultural power through which some mental health topics take prevalence over the others. Drawing on Twitter data, this research employs innovative methods of topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and panel data regression analyses. Theoretically, it combines, in a multidisciplinary fashion, concepts such as emotional energy and cognitive focus from sociology and bandwagon behavior from economics. Our findings show that low-cost attention mechanisms are ineffective in fostering online mental health discourse, whereas emotional energy and discursive variability have a positive influence by engaging audiences, creating online solidarity, and speaking to worldviews of audiences from different walks of life. Social media mental health discourse is also shown to be quite diverse and more stigma-neutral than such discourse in traditional media. • Emotional energy (engagement, confidence, and solidarity) drives mental health discourse on Twitter. • Low-cost attention generating mechanisms are ineffective in fostering online mental health discourse. • Online mental health discourse is subject to cognitive-emotional currents and requires content variability. • Discursive diversity drives general mental health discourse, subject-focused tweets drive the retrievability of a topic. • Stigma-related online mental health discourse is driven by sensationalism and positive emotions through the use of sarcasm.

The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political ""Left"" diverge from those on the ""Right""). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions. Analyses use data from two sources: an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing). Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors. Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived ""common ground,"" between the political ""Right"" and ""Left."" Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology. • COVID-19 mitigation behavior willingness varies by political identity. • Risk perceptions moderate the political identity - mitigation willingness link. • Political polarization of mitigation willingness is weakened by high perceived risk. • COVID-19 deaths may better communicate risk than COVID-19 infections.

We examined Twitter posts between January 2020 and September 2021 by Democratic and Republican politicians to determine how they framed the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these posts, we carried out a survey study between September and November 2021 to examine whether motivations for COVID-19 vaccine uptake matched message frames that were widely used by these politicians. Finally, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment to examine how these frames (economic vs. health) affected intentions to vaccinate by vaccine refusers in both parties. Republican politicians were more likely to frame the pandemic in economic terms, whereas Democrats predominantly used health frames. Accordingly, vaccinated Republicans' choices were more likely to be motivated by economic consideration (β = 0.25, p = 0.02) and personal financial rationales (β = 0.24, p = 0.03). Among vaccine refusers, Republicans exposed to messages using economic rationales to encourage vaccination reported higher vaccination intentions compared to those exposed to messages using public health rationales (F 1,119 = 4.16, p = 0.04). Messages highlighting economic and personal financial risks could increase intentions to vaccinate for vaccine-hesitant Republicans. Agencies should invest in developing messages that are congruent with frames that are already widely used by co-partisans. Social media may be helpful in eliciting these frames. • Republican politicians framed COVID-19 in economic terms on Twitter. • Vaccinated Republicans were motivated by economics and personal finance. • Economy-frame health messages increased Republicans' intent to vaccinate.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study posits that temporal focus will affect adherence behavior regarding health control measures, such as social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing, which will be manifested through the degree of spread of COVID-19. It is suggested that social media can provide an indicator of the general temporal focus of the population at a particular time. In this study, we examine the temporal focus of Twitter text data and the number of COVID-19 cases in the US over a 317-day period from the inception of the pandemic, using text analytics to classify the temporal content of 0.76 million tweets. The data is then analyzed using dynamic regression via advanced ARIMA modelling, differencing the data, removing weekly seasonality and creating a stationary time series. The result of the dynamic regression finds that past orientation does indeed have an effect on the growth of COVID-19 cases in the US. However, a present focus tends to reduce the spread of COVID cases. Future focus had no effect in the model. Overall, the research suggests that detecting and managing temporal focus could be an important tool in managing public health during a pandemic. • Examines temporal focus of US social media users and COVID infection rates. • Applies text analytics and dynamic regression via ARIMA on 0.76 million tweets. • Finds that past temporal focus is related to the growth of COVID-19 cases. • Present focus was related to a reduction in the spread of COVID cases. • Temporal focus could be helpful in managing public health during the pandemic.

The present study conducted econometric analyses (i.e., Granger causality tests) to assess the associations of legacy and social media coverage with risk perceptions and protective behaviors in the total sample and specific groups separated by pregnancy status/intent, geographic region, income, education level, age, and ethnicity. Results The results from the overall sample suggested that changes in the volume of information in legacy and social media (i.e., Twitter) were followed by different changes in community risk perceptions and protective behaviors. Specifically, social media coverage correlated with the level of risk perceptions, whereas the legacy media coverage correlated with the level of protective behaviors. Analyses across different subpopulations, including those of different pregnancy status/intent, geographic Zika risk, income, education level, age, and ethnicity, replicated the social media associations with risk perceptions in most cases. However, legacy media and protective behaviors were linked only in some vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., the less-educated populations).

The person is at the centre of the ecological framework to recognize how people define and organize both digital and physical communities and interactions. The relevance of interactions in physical environments depends on the built and natural characteristics encountered across modes of activity (e.g., domestic, work, study). Here, social interactions are stratified into the meso-social (e.g., local social norms) and micro-social (e.g., personal conversations) levels. The relevance of interactions in digital platforms is contingent on specific hardware and software elements. Social interactions at the meso-social level include platform norms and passive use of social media, such as observing the expressions of others, whereas interactions at the micro-level include more active uses, like direct messaging. Digital platforms are accessed in a physical location, and physical locations are partly experienced through online interactions; therefore, interactions between these environments are also acknowledged. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of applying the framework to studies of place and well-being.

The relevance of interactions in physical environments depends on the built and natural characteristics encountered across modes of activity (e.g., domestic, work, study). Here, social interactions are stratified into the meso-social (e.g., local social norms) and micro-social (e.g., personal conversations) levels. The relevance of interactions in digital platforms is contingent on specific hardware and software elements. Social interactions at the meso-social level include platform norms and passive use of social media, such as observing the expressions of others, whereas interactions at the micro-level include more active uses, like direct messaging. Digital platforms are accessed in a physical location, and physical locations are partly experienced through online interactions; therefore, interactions between these environments are also acknowledged. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of applying the framework to studies of place and well-being. • Social media has expanded opportunities to study place and well-being. • The discourse on place effects on well-being largely excludes digital places. • Interactions in digital places includes surrounding physical environments. • We present a unified ecological framework of place effects on well-being.

While previous literatures have been 'sanitized' to emphasize the importance of managing optimal physiological health and safety, we would like to argue that keener attention is needed to rethink the constitutive role of bodies in co-producing a city's sociopolitical ecologies at this time of crisis. The main body is divided into three sections. The first section introduces the political dimensions of pandemic response by various governments with an emphasis to experiences of middle to low income countries. Our intention is to show how these studies bring into light the role of local politics of pandemic response within countries, and that actual governance mechanisms in cities are shaped and contested by shifting power blocs and emergent affinities. The second section forwards an embodied urban political approach that conceptualizes bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure. In this view, bodies-in-waiting is produced and reproduced by complex social-material flows and transformation rooted in variegated matrices of power through which urban spaces are (re)assembled. The last section demonstrates a sample case that shows how bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are understood using Twitter-sourced data associated with the Philippine government's disciplinary quarantine measures which started March 12, 2020 in the NCR. At its core, bodies-in-waiting as infrastructures populate a politically affirmative urban imaginary of bodies living on despite the existence of an accelerated and mutating virus in slower moving cities. • A conceptual innovation of bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure. • Bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are assembled in contested moral fields. • Bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are politically affirmative spaces of living on. • Application of concept in understanding disciplinary quarantine measures.

We study 200 million interactions captured from Twitter during the early stage of the pandemic, from January to April 2020, to understand its socio-informational structure on a global scale. The COVID-19 global communication network is characterized by knowledge groups, hierarchically organized in sub-groups with well-defined geo-political and ideological characteristics. Communication is mostly segregated within groups and driven by a small number of subjects: 0.1% of users account for up to 45% and 10% of activities and news shared, respectively, centralizing the information flow. Contradicting the idea that digital social media favor active participation and co-creation of online content, our results imply that public health policy strategies to counter the effects of the infodemic must not only focus on information content, but also on the social articulation of its diffusion mechanisms, as a given community tends to be relatively impermeable to news generated by non-aligned sources. • Global communication related to Covid-19 is characterized by knowledge communities. • Information cascades are segregated within groups and driven by few subjects. • Communities are relatively impermeable to news generated by non-aligned sources. • Political orientations play a strong structuring role on community identity. • Scientific communication is a marginal fringe of the digital information ecosystem.

However, such measures are complex when established borders are open yet politically contested, as for the border that divides the Republic of Ireland (ROI) from Northern Ireland (NI).

This multi-methods study aimed to explore public perspectives on how the ROI-NI border affected experiences of and responses to the 'first wave' of the pandemic. The study collated data from focus groups (n = 8), news articles (n = 967), and Twitter posts (n = 356) on the island of Ireland, which mentioned the ROI-NI border in relation to COVID-19. Thematic analysis was used to explore the range of perspectives on the role played by the border during the early months of the pandemic. Analysis identified three themes: Cross-Border Interdependencies illustrated the complexity and challenges of living near the border; Interpretations of Cross-Border Policy Disparities showed that lay publics perceived NI and ROI policy approaches as discordant and politicised; and Responses to Cross-Border Policy Disparities revealed alternating calls to either strengthen border controls, or pursue a unified all-island approach. Results reveal clear public appetite for greater synchronisation of cross-border pandemic responses, emphasise the specific vulnerability of communities living near the border, and highlight the risk of long-term socio-political repercussions of border management decisions taken during the pandemic.

The fact that the traditional approach of the e-diaspora yielded few results prompted us to follow a new research strategy combining data from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. Because of a particularly fortuitous coincidence with the Egyptian revolt, we could investigate the mobilization of Egyptian migrants in pursuit of their voting rights on the micro-blogging platform Twitter. Through Twitter data, we identified links that were not visible through traditional Web-mapping techniques, and we could observe the emergence of a transnational Egyptian community debating and fighting for a common cause.

It came to public attention around the turn of the millennium when the human genome began to be deciphered. Initial findings from epigenetics research held the promise of changing how we think about health and illness, evolution and heredity; speculations about how individuals and populations could begin to control such processes through epigenetics were then picked up in the public realm. In this article we concentrate on two normally distant domains within the public sphere: the advertising of alternative health products and services, and the promotion of alternative approaches to social science, especially around how social science deals with the 'biosocial'. Using insights from social representations theory and methods aligned with metaphor analysis, we investigate the meanings of epigenetics rooted in the use of metaphors and commonplaces that are circulating in current popular parlance and that are used to promote academic theories and ideas as well as tangible products and services. We compare and contrast them and assess their implications for collaborations between natural and social scientists. Our findings reveal some surprising similarities between the metaphors and commonplaces used by advertisers and social scientists, based in large part on the fact that both groups draw on the work of prominent epigeneticists. In both instances some fundamental tenets of mainstream biology are contested, and hopes are created for improving individual or population well-being through the manipulation of epigenetic mechanisms. Both domains share some misunderstandings of epigenetics that might lead to problems with interdisciplinary collaborations between social and natural scientists.

More importantly, beyond looking at journalists’ general Twitter use, this study expands the literature by distinguishing between expressive Twitter use (e.g., tweeting messages) and consumptive Twitter use (e.g., reading others’ tweets). Results showed that journalists’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls were associated differently depending on patterns of expressive and consumptive Twitter usage.

The primary question addressed is what systematic determinants shape the decision to adopt Twitter as a component of an MC''s media strategy. Using data collected from MC Twitter accounts and the 2008 congressional election, I find partisan, cohort, and ideological determinants on early Twitter adoption. Republicans are more likely to use Twitter even in multivariate analysis; ideological extremism influences the use of Twitter.

We unpack whether media consumption influences such preferences in Texas, a racially segregated and increasingly racially diverse state. Methods Using the Texas Diversity Survey (n= 1,322), we run a series of logit regression models, stratified by respondent race (Black, Latinx, Multiracial, and White), to measure the relationship between media consumption and racial residential preferences. Results We find that racial residential preferences are shaped not only by expected attributes (e.g., age, education, racial composition of current neighborhood of residence) but also by whether mainstream media are consumed for Latinx respondents. Whites who consume ethnic media are significantly more likely to prefer living in Black and Latinx communities.

Results: We find that candidates discussed a small number of distinct issues. Sentiment analysis reveals that the emotions used to convey these topics varied considerably more than interparty emphasis. Moreover, we observe that Democrats and Republicans discussed the same topics in very different ways, with Democrats—the out‐party at the time—proving more negative in their messaging.

Results: Social media blame attributions emerge at the outset of the storm and are more likely to center on federal actors, followed by local actors. State actors received the least blame.

Second, Donald Trump and Barak Obama show the opposite result for the in‐degree centrality and follower analysis. The result shows that the topic‐based networks and the person‐based networks play a different role in social networks. This study demonstrates that the presidents, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, the Centers for Disease Control, and news channels play a crucial role in the news of COVID‐19 for people. Key players, such as Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and BBC, are located in the central networks. In contrast, U.S. news channels and WHO and its regional offices have independent channels.

Sociological Research Online 19 (3): 277–283; Morrison 2019. Scroungers: Moral Panics and Media Myths. London: Zed Books). Historical distinctions between the ""deserving"" and ""undeserving poor"" have been sharpened by successive governments in the service of varying shades of neoliberal governance. While Margaret Thatcher castigated ""shirkers"" in fostering an ideology of economic self-reliance, both New Labour and the Coalition obsessed over ""welfare reform"": promoting an ideology of ""work"" in symbolic opposition to supposed cultures of ""worklessness"". But, while ""scroungerphobia"" (Deacon 1978. ""The Scrounging Controversy: Public Attitudes Towards the Unemployed in Contemporary Britain."" Social Policy and Administration 12 (2): 120–135) is now a widely recognised sociological phenomenon, scholarly attention to the concept has largely been reserved for its manifestation in tabloid newspapers, political rhetoric and, latterly, ""poverty porn"" television. Even recent work considering the public's contribution to scrounger discourse(s) on social media focuses on mainstream platforms, such as Twitter and newspaper comment threads (e.g. Van Der Bom et al. 2018. ""'It's not the Fact They Claim Benefits but Their Useless, Lazy, Drug Taking Lifestyles we Despise': Analysing Audience Responses to Benefits Street Using Live Tweets.""

This paper begins to address this oversight, by examining how normative anti-welfare discourses infiltrate everyday communication in more disparate online communities – including niche consumer forums. It draws on previously unpublished findings from an analysis of welfare-related conversations in these and other spaces at the height of a recent moral panic over ""scroungers"": the period from 2013-2016, when Conservative-led governments strove to legitimise sweeping benefit cuts and punitive ""welfare reform"".

This term operates as a significant in-community discourse about marginalization and social injustice, as well as how queer people can performatively manipulate public perceptions about themselves. In many popular media texts though, realness is used to convey neoliberal ideologies such as that publicly embracing and utilizing one's minority differences is a sure path to cultural and economic success. I trace the nuances of this semiotic shift by conducting a content and textual analysis of realness across seven seasons of Drag Race as well as in limited-character Twitter posts.

The article begins by exploring ways in which Trump's social media performance exhibits the characteristics of ""hypermasculinity"". The analysis then turns to the everyday expression of traditionally macho masculinity by Trump by conducting a search for tokens of the masculine-gendered nouns ""man"" and ""guy"", and using critical discourse analysis to reveal the use of these in exercising gendered forms of judgement. Of particular importance is the informal ""guy"", through which Trump defines challengers within power-based masculine oppositions. Overall, we find that while the concept of hypermasculinity is useful in describing provocative displays of ""bad behaviour"" oriented-towards a populist style of leadership, but that Trump routinely produces more banal types of masculine performance that objectify allies and opponents within a gendered hierarchy, and may be said to normalise regressive forms of masculinity within the prevailing political culture.

In the paper, the theoretical and methodological approach to multimodal social media dialogue explores the interdependence between the design and the use of social media, showing how social media provide pre-designed templates for exchanging of information and how users respond to these technological affordances through dialogic forms. A social semiotic, multimodal approach to dialogue recognizes that dialogue involves not only a functional exchange structure, but also emotive or evaluative correspondence. This paper therefore explores social media: (i) As a functional structure, drawing on theories of exchange structure and genre, and (ii) As realizing evaluative (emotive) correspondence. Based on a corpus of social media dialogues on a number of different platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Viber, Flickr, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Twitter), the paper presents some analysis of the exchange structure and genre in social media dialogues and later emotive online correspondence in relation to “off the shelf” responses and emoticons.

This article examines structures of collaborative data collection between professional scientists and various field recorders around the Cornell Library of Natural Sounds. The Library collects animal sound recordings for use in education, preservation, and entertainment, but primarily in the scientific field of bio-acoustics. Since 1945, the Library has enlisted academic researchers, commercial recorders and broadcasters (such as the British Broadcasting Corporation), and amateur sound hunters in its expansion. I argue that the Cornell Library of Natural Sounds managed to craft and sustain a crucial network of contributors through creative and strategic brokering with its collection of recordings/data. Drawing on notions from exchange theory, I show that sound recordings were valued not just as scientific data, but also as copyrighted commodities that could be bought, sold, traded, and converted in a range of economic, social, and symbolic capitals within collaborators’ respective social fields. Thus, aligning collaborators’ interests, these exchange relations enabled the Cornell Library of Natural Sounds to negotiate amateur recorders’ reliability, willingness to share work, and commitment to scientific standards, as well as the bonds that solidified their collaboration with the Cornell Library of Natural Sounds. Attending to the micro-economics of data exchange, this article thus brings into perspective the multi-dimensional processes through which data-flows are managed.

Social Work is currently facing the significant challenge of dealing with social networking sites - which have become a parallel universe of socialisation - in which ever-increasing digital activism is taking place. The #MeToo movement stands out as a global benchmark. It has established itself as a digital-global feminist movement, fighting harassment and the abuse of women. Methodology. Adopting a social work perspective, a longitudinal analysis was performed of the #MeToo movement on Twitter between 2018-2019 based on social network analysis and netnography, in conjunction with specific algorithms. Results. The results showed significant patterns of sorority, homophily and affective polarisation through the echo chambers and filter bubbles that were identified in the detected Twitter communities. Furthermore, these online communities reflected real offline characteristics (geographical location, affinities, similarities). Discussion and conclusions. The #MeToo movement's global effect and durability has led to a new understanding of social movements in the digital era. Social workers must not be blind to the exciting digital opportunities arising from digitalisation. They must combat homophily and the polarisation of global society on social networking sites, promoting values oriented towards tolerance of diversity. Practitioners must show awareness and intervene proactively in global digital spheres to understand, reflect and promote social justice, equality of rights and the empowerment of disadvantaged, vulnerable and oppressed people.

Building on an earlier, single-university exploration of students’ views, the study made use of social media (Twitter) to access opinions of students from seven universities across the UK using an online survey tool. Whilst it is not possible to make generalising claims based on ‘opt in’ research of this nature, the findings are nevertheless suggestive of some important issues for those working with social work students today. Principally, they showed that understandings of feminism in the student cohort were diverse and may be very different to the feminism that an older generation of academic and fieldwork educators may have grown up with. The article argues that it is important, in the light of this, to interrogate what we mean by feminism in our work with students. This will then allow us to open up wider conversations about power, agency and structure, thus bringing greater criticality and reflexivity to our teaching and learning.

We propose a critical analysis of a sample of tweets with these two hashtags collected between 3 and 9 March 2019, coinciding with the #8M strike. We have established three dimensions of analysis for the qualitative study of these tweets: the war on the normal bloke, the mirror discourse, and feminist tyranny. The operationalization of these categories has allowed us to reveal the discursive processes through which the co-optation of the victim’s space by popular misogyny operates.

Background: While many studies analyze the functions that images can fulfill during humanitarian crises or catastrophes, an understanding of how meaning is constructed in text-image relationships is lacking. This article explores how discourses are produced using different types of text-image interactions. It presents a case study focusing on a humanitarian crisis, more specifically the sexual transmission of Ebola. 2. Methods: Data were processed both quantitatively and qualitatively through a keyword-based selection. Tweets containing an image were retrieved from a database of 210,600 tweets containing the words ""Ebola"" and ""semen"", in English and in French, over the course of 12 months. When this first selection was crossed with the imperative of focusing on a specific thematic (the sexual transmission of Ebola) and avoiding off-topic text-image relationships, it led to reducing the corpus to 182 tweets. 3. Results: The article proposes a four-category classification of text-image relationships. Theoretically, it provides original insights into how discourses are built in social media; it also highlights the semiotic significance of images in expressing an opinion or an emotion. 4. Conclusion: The results suggest that the process of signification needs to be rethought: Content enhancement and dialogism through images have a bearing on Twitter's use as a public sphere, such as credibilization of discourses or politicization of events. This opens the way to a new, more comprehensive approach to the rhetorics of users on Twitter.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Twitter; social media; pragmatics; TWITTER; DISEASES; EBOLA; health crisis; text-image relationships,WOS,,,,,,,,

This paper answers some of these questions using statistical analyses and by dividing overall social media use into selected social media, i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitter. The analysis used a dataset that contains information related to 2002 respondents from the U.S. and their social media activity. The results show that people with high household incomes and high education use social media the most. As age increases, social media use decreases, while bigger household income means that social media are used more.

For just as long, some Black women have resisted their mischaracterizations. Instead they have embraced a 'fat' identity. But little research has demonstrated how Black fat women participate in sport. The purpose of this study is to show how Black fat women who run use social media to unapologetically celebrate Blackness and fatness. This research uses a case-study approach to illuminate a broader phenomenon of decolonial resistance through running. In addition to analysis of websites, blogs, and news articles devoted to Black women's running, we discuss the (social) media content of two specific runners: Mirna Valerio and Latoya Shauntay Snell. We performed a critical discourse analysis on 14 media offerings from the two runners, including websites, Twitter pages, and blogs collected over a five-month period from September 2020-January 2021. The analysis examined how they represent themselves and their communities and how they comment on issues of anti-fat bias, neoliberal capitalism, ableist sexism, and white supremacy, some of the pillars of colonialism. Whereas running is often positioned as a weight-loss-focused and white-dominated colonial project, through their very presence and use of strategic communication to amplify their experiences and build community, these runners show how being a Black fat female athlete is an act of decolonial resistance. This study offers a unique sporting example of how fat women challenge obesity discourses and cultural invisibility and how Black athletes communicate anti-racist, decolonial principles.",MEDIA; POLITICS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; HEALTH; sport; critical discourse analysis; women; NEOLIBERALISM; OBESITY; BODY-IMAGE; CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; decolonize; fatness; running; SPEAKING; WEIGHT,WOS,,,,,,,,

Assessing Community Engagement in San Francisco Community Benefit Agreements,SOCIETIES,10.3390/soc9010025,,"A community benefit agreement (CBA) that provides tax breaks to a company often has provisions to help uplift the area where the business resides. A number of San Francisco companies, especially those in the technology sector, have received tax relief, a tangible benefit granted in exchange for operating in designated blighted areas, the details of which are delineated in publicly available CBAs. One CBA requirement for the tax break-community engagement-defies easy measurement. This paper assesses whether San Francisco companies were held accountable for fulfilling this unclear but core CBA requirement, namely, engagement with disenfranchised community members, an important part of their corporate social responsibility. To assess the community engagement stipulation of CBAs, this paper presents background on CBAs followed by interview data from two anonymous community liaisons who were formerly or are currently responsible for community engagement at companies that received the tax break. Themes found in the interview data highlight the limitations of CBAs that result from the unequal social exchange between companies and the indigent residents of blighted areas where the businesses are located. The study concludes that the benefits of the vague and unenforceable community engagement provision of CBAs do not justify the companies' payroll tax exclusion. The disproportionality of this quid pro quo risks aggravating impoverished residents' resentment of companies and their employees. The relevance of this study's low participation rate among community liaisons is also discussed.",technology; corporate social responsibility; community benefit agreements; community engagement; gentrification; payroll tax exclusion; San Francisco; Tenderloin; Twitter tax break,WOS,,,,,,,,

Strategies of Legitimation in the EU-UK Post-Brexit Debate on COVID-19 Vaccination Campaigns,SOCIETIES,10.3390/soc12020037,,"The initial stage of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been slow-moving and marred by supply disruptions in the EU. These problems have triggered severe criticism toward the institutions and highlighted a stark contrast compared to Britain's vaccination campaign, which, at the beginning of 2021, was one of the fastest in the continent. In the ensuing debate between the EU and the UK on their uneven vaccination rates, the Brexit argument has been repeatedly invoked: Some political commentators have argued that the reason why COVID-19 vaccination campaign could run so smoothly in Britain is that the country was not held back by the EU's slow approval process. This paper observes the way in which Britain emphasized its blistering vaccination pace to deflect criticism against Brexit. From a discursive perspective, Britain's vaccine success was used to vindicate the Brexit project, providing a new argument in favour of its indispensable and timely nature. At the other end of a binary rhetoric, the EU officials attempted to shatter confidence in the 'British vaccine', while also depositing blame on other factors triggering the EU's delay, such as the shortage of pharmaceutical supplies. The analytical part of this paper foregrounds strategies of discursive legitimation to observe how, and to what extent, the Brexit debate is being reshaped in UK and EU media by looking at a corpus of political tweets. The rhetorical strategies adopted by UK political leaders and EU officials to (de)legitimise national and supranational choices with reference to the COVID-19 vaccination campaign are observed through the lens of Critical Discourse Analysis as it embraces the idea that discursive acts are in dialectical relation to the social and institutional structures in which they are framed.",CRISIS; legitimation strategies; DISCOURSES; discourse studies; discursive articulations of Brexit; EU-UK debate on COVID-19 vaccination campaign; IMAGINARY; political and institutional tweets; REFERENDUM,WOS,,,,,,,,

Overall, the hashtag describes the public reaction and debate with respect to mixed-gender friendship in Saudi Arabia, simultaneously highlighting the contribution of the evoked tweeted arguments in raising awareness of mixed-gender friendship restrictions imposed under the configuration of religious, social, and political discourses.

While useful for understanding cross-national differences, they are expensive to collect, include only a limited number of issues and countries, and are not very time sensitive. Many countries across the world now have residents who regularly use Twitter and Google, and these internet platforms are increasingly making data on the country-level number of tweets and google searches available for analysis. While there are a lot of challenges with these data, we examine some of the potential benefits. Specifically, our study assesses the extent to which cross-national social media and survey measures related to religious expression are related. Focusing on Africa, where surveys are particularly difficult to administer, and religious expression, which is quite common across the continent, is high, we find that our religion-related measures derived from google searches correspond particularly well with traditional social science measures. We then look at how all three sets of measures explain terrorism, health-related issues, and the number of Christian and Muslim official holidays within the country. We find that the measures derived from Google almost always perform as well, if not better, than the traditional social science measures. We discuss how internet data may be able to offer reliable and time-sensitive measures for examining differences across nations and for better understanding a range of issues in Africa.

This study constitutes a wide-ranging investigation that explores how Twitter's platform has been used in the debate regarding whether mixed-gender friendships should be allowed in the Saudi context. Adopting the tools of critical discourse analysis, the study analyses the detailed discourses and discursive strategies pertaining to mixed-gender friendship in a hashtag thread of 8050 tweets collected in September 2020. Overall, the hashtag describes the public reaction and debate with respect to mixed-gender friendship in Saudi Arabia, simultaneously highlighting the contribution of the evoked tweeted arguments in raising awareness of mixed-gender friendship restrictions imposed under the configuration of religious, social, and political discourses. The data analyzed demonstrates that the differences in arguments concerning mixed-gender friendships within the forms of dissent and protest are in a dialogically supportive relation with dominant political, religious, and social conservative discourses.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Twitter; WOMEN; Critical discourse analysis; LEGITIMATION; POLARIZATION; ARABIA; Gender segregation; Hashtag; Mixed-gender; REFORM; Saudi Arabia,WOS,,,,,,,,

While useful for understanding cross-national differences, they are expensive to collect, include only a limited number of issues and countries, and are not very time sensitive. Many countries across the world now have residents who regularly use Twitter and Google, and these internet platforms are increasingly making data on the country-level number of tweets and google searches available for analysis. While there are a lot of challenges with these data, we examine some of the potential benefits. Specifically, our study assesses the extent to which cross-national social media and survey measures related to religious expression are related. Focusing on Africa, where surveys are particularly difficult to administer, and religious expression, which is quite common across the continent, is high, we find that our religion-related measures derived from google searches correspond particularly well with traditional social science measures. We then look at how all three sets of measures explain terrorism, health-related issues, and the number of Christian and Muslim official holidays within the country. We find that the measures derived from Google almost always perform as well, if not better, than the traditional social science measures. We discuss how internet data may be able to offer reliable and time-sensitive measures for examining differences across nations and for better understanding a range of issues in Africa.",Social media; Research; Africa; ALCOHOL; ATTENTION; Cross-national; HIV; INSIGHTS; Religion; SEARCH; SEXUAL-BEHAVIORS,WOS,,,,,,,,

The study attempts sentiment analysis. For this purpose, QSR NVIVO 12, the qualitative analysis tool was used to retrieve the tweets from the Twitter website. NCapture was installed for this purpose. Post data cleaning, stemming, query augmentation and classification, the Twitter data was analysed. Findings. The sentiments around the IPO of Paytm have been negative and sarcastic. The extremely negative tweets were near twice the number of extremely positive tweets. Practical implication. The study can help an investor in evaluating the investment that they might be planning in the given company. For the company, whose IPO is being considered, an analysis of the sentiments around the IPO can help in taking corrective measures, if the sentiment is negative, towards reputation building. Originality/value. The study is an original contribution to the extant literature in the field of sentiment analysis.

Although the nonstandard form has been labeled in the literature as a calque of Spanish tener que + infinitive 'to have to', it appears in Twitter messages in all of the dialects analyzed. In fact, in our sample there are dialects in which tenir que occurs more frequently than haver de. Grammatical person of the verb used (haver or tenir) is also analyzed as a factor behind the choice of modal periphrasis. Multivariate analysis has been employed, determining that both of these factors (dialect and grammatical person) are statistically significant. The results of the multivariate analysis allow us to apply van Coetsem's (1988) theoretical framework in an attempt to describe the language contact situation in the different dialects. Source-language (sl) agentivity appears to be at work in the dialects where the nonstandard variant is prevalent, while recipient-language (rl) agentivity could be behind the use of the standard variant in the other dialects.

Thus we propose to consider these structures as an integral part of what we call collective action socio-technical systems, i.e., a multipolar and multidimensional system of technologically enabled social relations that deploys simultaneously online and offline; and to analyze them empirically through a network approach and techniques paying specific attention to actors, connections between them, contents they produce and patterns of contents circulation.

We examine areas of discomfort among low-income, non-traditional, and minority students, including the lack of technology and internet connectivity in the students' households before college, abuse in social media, creating community and networks, and proper and improper usage of social media. We also argue that teaching of social media use that does not address these areas of discomfort may exacerbate cumulative disadvantages (Diprete and Eirich 2006). We examine how one's background plays a role in creating comfort and discomfort using social media. We provide strategies based on years of experience and past surveys of empowering all students in the classroom by using social media related to our primary teaching areas: race, health, culture, and methods.

This study presents a content analysis of the use of public Facebook groups created by and for survivors of the Camp Fire approximately 1 year after the event. It examines 480 posts from seven groups during a 2-week period from November 19, 2019 through December 2, 2019. Users were most often seeking or providing informational support, but they also frequently used the groups for community-building. Less frequent uses included instrumental, material, and emotional supports.

This article shows that the specific application of geodemographics for discerning between different types of tweeters is problematic in some ways, but that the general process of classifying tweeters according to their position in geographical space is viable and represents a powerful new method for discerning the social position of tweeters. Further research is required in this area, as there is great potential in employing the mobile global positioning system data appended to digital by-product data to explore the intersections between geographical space and social position.

We also expand on the three types of geographical information that can be derived from Tweets either directly or by proxy and how spatial information can be used to link social media with official curated data. Whilst we make no grand claims about the representative nature of Twitter users in relation to the wider UK population, the derivation of demographic data demonstrates the potential of new social media (NSM) for the social sciences.

In the past, the disorganized structure of these groups, their flaws, and dissonance over a common criterion to support or oppose IR and its activities posed some obstacles to their unity. However, over the last decade, they have reached consensus over the subversion of the IR. As a decentralized and disorganized social movement emerging in the wake of 2017 and 2019 protests, this discourse has gained momentum among the political activists, and more people are joining this trend every day, and it is very popular on Persian language social media, especially on Twitter. Loss of faith in the reforms of the IR is one of the issues upon which this discourse movement has reached a general consensus. By exploring and describing the main signifiers of the disorganized subversion discourse in Iran, the article seeks to identify its major characteristics through the qualitative-descriptive analysis of Farsi Twitter content. The research method was the content analysis of Farsi Twitter hashtags of the most popular user accounts belonging to the subversive movement in Iran by extracting the main signifiers and their discourse analysis to examine the main characteristics of the subversion discourse in Iran after 2017.

It is self-evident that collaboration between social scientists and social media analysis companies offers the potential for developing methods for analysing social change on large scales, bringing together their respective expertise in technological innovations and knowledge of social science. What is less well known is how such a partnership might work in practice. This article presents an example of such a collaboration, highlighting the opportunities and challenges that arose in the context of an exploration of feminism on Twitter.

Canonical process-oriented researchers such as Elias used mixed-methods approaches, including visual maps and quantitative surveys. By comparing 17th-century digitized diaries and 5 million digitized books from Google Books with contemporary tweet data, this study provides a successful case of comparing tweets with historical printed text at a big data scale. Moreover, quantitative methods are important to process-oriented methodologies and can be extended to big data empirical sources. An important finding is that there are similarities in the curation of everyday life in elite historical diaries and in more democratic forms of contemporary social media. Although accessibility and volume of content have changed over time from historical text to tweets, we found that there is a marked preference for certain words associated with communal sentiment over the centuries.

However the fact that demographics information is not explicit does not mean that it is not implicitly present. Utilising the Cardiff Online Social Media Observatory (COSMOS) this paper suggests various techniques for establishing or estimating demographic data from a sample of more than 113 million Twitter users collected during July 2012. We discuss in detail the methods that can be used for identifying gender and language and Illustrate that the proportion of males and females using Twitter in the UK reflects the gender balance observed in the 2011 Census. We also expand on the three types of geographical information that can be derived from Tweets either directly or by proxy and how spatial information can be used to link social media with official curated data. Whilst we make no grand claims about the representative nature of Twitter users in relation to the wider UK population, the derivation of demographic data demonstrates the potential of new social media (NSM) for the social sciences. We consider this paper a clarion call and hope that other researches test the methods we suggest and develop the further.",Twitter; CRISIS; Demographics; GENDER IDENTIFICATION; New Social Media; PRIVACY; Sampling; Social Media Analytics; Social Science,WOS,,,,,,,,

Drawing on interviews with 26 gay and bisexual men based in the UK who identify as 'pups', it demonstrates how a kinky sexual subculture exists on a social networking site in new and innovative ways, adapting various elements of Twitter to form a unique subculture that I call 'Pup Twitter'. Engaging with debates about social trends related to sexuality, as well as contemporary understandings of social networking sites, the study documents how this subcultural sexual community, while predating Twitter, has adopted online methods to enhance communication, engagement, and even visibility. The intersection of sexuality and social networking sites is an area ripe for further study, and this article develops empirical and conceptual ways to examine this issue in the future.",ATTITUDES; ONLINE; Twitter; BDSM; community; kink; online; sexuality; TUMBLR,WOS,,,,,,,,

In the past, the disorganized structure of these groups, their flaws, and dissonance over a common criterion to support or oppose IR and its activities posed some obstacles to their unity. However, over the last decade, they have reached consensus over the subversion of the IR. As a decentralized and disorganized social movement emerging in the wake of 2017 and 2019 protests, this discourse has gained momentum among the political activists, and more people are joining this trend every day, and it is very popular on Persian language social media, especially on Twitter. Loss of faith in the reforms of the IR is one of the issues upon which this discourse movement has reached a general consensus. By exploring and describing the main signifiers of the disorganized subversion discourse in Iran, the article seeks to identify its major characteristics through the qualitative-descriptive analysis of Farsi Twitter content. The research method was the content analysis of Farsi Twitter hashtags of the most popular user accounts belonging to the subversive movement in Iran by extracting the main signifiers and their discourse analysis to examine the main characteristics of the subversion discourse in Iran after 2017.",Twitter; discourse; Iran; movement; subversion,WOS,,,,,,,,

The method involves the identification of a given tweeter's likely location of residence from the 'geo-tag' attached to their tweet. Using this high-resolution geographic information, each individual tweet is then attributed a geodemographic classification. This article shows that the specific application of geodemographics for discerning between different types of tweeters is problematic in some ways, but that the general process of classifying tweeters according to their position in geographical space is viable and represents a powerful new method for discerning the social position of tweeters. Further research is required in this area, as there is great potential in employing the mobile global positioning system data appended to digital by-product data to explore the intersections between geographical space and social position.",Twitter; social media; CRISIS; digital methods; coming crisis; geodemographics; GPS; social class; socio-spatial analysis; SOFTWARE; Tweet analysis; Twitter analysis,WOS,,,,,,,,

However, the speed and scale of this growth presents challenges for social scientists, particularly those whose methodologies tend to rely on the qualitative analysis of data that are gathered firsthand. Alongside the growth of social media, companies have emerged which have developed tools for interrogating 'big data', although often unconnected from social scientists. It is self-evident that collaboration between social scientists and social media analysis companies offers the potential for developing methods for analysing social change on large scales, bringing together their respective expertise in technological innovations and knowledge of social science. What is less well known is how such a partnership might work in practice. This article presents an example of such a collaboration, highlighting the opportunities and challenges that arose in the context of an exploration of feminism on Twitter. As will be shown, machine-learning technologies allow the analysis of data on a scale that would be impossible for human analysts, yet such approaches also heighten challenges regarding the study of social change and communication.",MEDIA; feminism; Twitter; qualitative analysis; social media; collaboration; machine learning; 'big data'; WOMENS MOVEMENT,WOS,,,,,,,,

There is a lack of theoretically informed approaches to studying recently digitized historical text with contemporary social media. This article argues that such perspectives are needed and extends Norbert Elias' notions of sociogenesis' and psychogenesis' into data-driven research. Canonical process-oriented researchers such as Elias used mixed-methods approaches, including visual maps and quantitative surveys. By comparing 17th-century digitized diaries and 5million digitized books from Google Books with contemporary tweet data, this study provides a successful case of comparing tweets with historical printed text at a big data scale. Moreover, quantitative methods are important to process-oriented methodologies and can be extended to big data empirical sources. An important finding is that there are similarities in the curation of everyday life in elite historical diaries and in more democratic forms of contemporary social media. Although accessibility and volume of content have changed over time from historical text to tweets, we found that there is a marked preference for certain words associated with communal sentiment over the centuries.",Twitter; social media; big data; democratization; computational social science; diaries; linguistic change; Norbert Elias; TWITTER,WOS,,,,,,,,

However, close-up, qualitative sociological research has not been conducted into the relationship between Brexit and social media use. This is, in part, due to the computational turn in online research, which has led to a disproportionate focus on quantitative big data analysis. This article argues for the value of close-up, qualitative enquiry to facilitate situated understandings of the reality of social media use and what it means to individuals. It outlines one such methodology developed to investigate pro-Leave Facebook users, to demonstrate how challenges posed by such research can be overcome, and the opportunities such enquiry affords for studying the role of social media in contentious politics.

The UK Space of Political Attitudes After the Brexit Referendum",SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE,10.1177/1360780420965982,,"This study focuses on the political attitudes of UK citizens in the aftermath of the 'Brexit' vote. It has been argued that differences within electorates across Europe are found in disputes over taxes, redistribution of wealth and social welfare, as much as in divergent ideas on how to deal with globalisation, migration, and climate change. This article uses the 2016-2017 round of the European Social Survey (N = 1959) to shed light on two important issues in regard to the relationship between 'old' and 'new' politics. By using multiple correspondence analysis, we first consider the structure, or dimensionality, of the space of political attitudes in contemporary UK society. Contrary to a prevailing discourse that forwards the argument that postmaterial values constitute an altogether separate political dimension in late modernity, we observe that such values collapse into traditional left/right standpoints. Second, we discuss the connection between class (economic capital, cultural capital, and occupational class) and position-takings in the space of political attitudes. We show that class retains a limited effect on political position-takings, where educational capital plays the most important role. The divisions between the politically interested-uninterested, old-young, men-women, and rural-urban are more clearly demarcated than differences between people of different social class positions. Furthermore, polarisation is most prevalent between a highly opinionated, relatively resourceful, small minority of the population.",Brexit; UK; class; CULTURE; polarisation; Bourdieu; TWITTER; DENMARK; GAL-TAN; HOMOLOGY; multiple correspondence analysis; new politics; old politics; POSITIONS; space of political attitudes,WOS,,,,,,,,

This frame normatively licenses withdrawal from intergenerational action in pursuit of collective objectives, as well as erases the disproportionate negative effects of crisis conditions on those facing intersecting intragenerational disadvantages. In addition to analysing a strategic but thus far unexplored data source for social problems theory and the sociology of generations – tweets – the article contributes to this scholarship by demonstrating how generational ideas work to morally link different conditions to each other.

Some authors have posited significant overlap between, on the one hand, sociological and STS concepts, and on the other hand, the ontologies of digital media.

This paper advocates a third approach, one that (a) highlights the dynamism and relative under-determinacy of digital methods, and (b) affirms that multiple methodological traditions intersect in digital devices and research. We argue that these two circumstances enable a distinctive approach to methodology in digital social research - thinking methods as 'interface methods' - and the paper contextualizes this approach in two different ways. First, we show how the proliferation of online data tools or 'digital analytics' opens up distinctive opportunities for critical and creative engagement with methods development at the intersection of sociology, STS and digital research. Second, we discuss a digital research project in which we investigated a specific 'interface method', namely co-occurrence analysis. In this digital pilot study we implemented this method in a critical and creative way to analyse and visualize 'issue dynamics' in the area of climate change on Twitter. We evaluate this project in the light of our principal objective, which was to test the possibilities for the modification of methods through experimental implementation and interfacing of various methodological traditions. To conclude, we discuss a major obstacle to the development of 'interface methods': digital media are marked by particular quantitative dynamics that seem adverse to some of the methodological commitments of sociology and STS. To address this, we argue in favour of a methodological approach in digital social research that affirms its maladjustment to the research methods that are prevalent in the medium.

To conclude, we discuss a major obstacle to the development of interface methods': digital media are marked by particular quantitative dynamics that seem adverse to some of the methodological commitments of sociology and STS. To address this, we argue in favour of a methodological approach in digital social research that affirms its maladjustment to the research methods that are prevalent in the medium.",digital methods; CHALLENGE; ISSUE; social media analytics; actor-network theory; digital social research; inter-disciplinary methodology; politics of technology; CONTROVERSIES; LIVE; PROVOCATIONS,WOS,,,,,,,,

This article focuses on the affordances and constraints of different social media platforms as they are perceived by Italian activists. Instead of focusing on single protest movements, or on single platforms, we adopt a media ecological approach and consider a variety of environments where people can choose to express protest-related content. Our main goal is to explore whether, and how, the affordances and constraints of different social media platforms are perceived by users, and how such perceived differences are integrated in everyday social media activities. To this end, we combined in-depth interviews with an adapted version of the cognitive walkthrough and thinking aloud techniques. Respondents reported that they act on social media platforms according to specific representations of what each platform is', and how it works. Such perceptions affect users' protest-related social media practices. Although they perceive major social media platforms filtering strategies and are aware, to different extents, of their commodified nature, they report continuing to use them for activism-related communication, often adopting an instrumental approach.",POLITICS; FACEBOOK; social media; YOUTH; ORGANIZATION; activism; TWITTER; affordances and constraints; cognitive walkthrough; media ecological approach; media ideologies,WOS,,,,,,,,

It probes the extent to which opposition to austerity expressed on Twitter contributes to building bridges among disparate social groups affected by austerity politics and to enabling their joint collective action. The study aims to add to the scholarship on anti-austerity protests since the credit crunch. Numerous of those protests have been accompanied by vibrant activity on social media. Rather than to propose yet another examination of participant mobilisation on social media, the analysis delineates and seeks to evidence a process of social learning among the social media following of a social movement. Relying on a combination of social network, semantic and discourse analysis, the authors discuss movement social learning as a diffusion process transpiring in the communication over an extended period of substantive and organisational issues, strategy and critical reflections that crystallised a cohesive in-group among the participant entities in the People's Assembly.

Ethnographic studies of the 2013 Gezi uprising seem to answer ""yes,"" pointing to solidarity among groups that were traditionally indifferent, or even hostile, to one another. We argue that two mechanisms with differing implications may generate this observed outcome: ""influence"" (change in attitude caused by interacting with other participants); and ""selection"" (individuals who participated in the movement were generally more supportive of other groups beforehand). We tease out the relative importance of these mechanisms by constructing a panel of over 30,000 Twitter users and analyzing their support for the main Turkish opposition parties before, during, and after the movement. We find that although individuals changed in significant ways, becoming in general more supportive of the other opposition parties, those who participated in the movement were also significantly more supportive of the other parties all along. These findings suggest that both mechanisms were important, but that selection dominated. In addition to our substantive findings, our paper also makes a methodological contribution that we believe could be useful to studies of social movements and mass opinion change more generally. In contrast with traditional panel studies, which must be designed and implemented prior to the event of interest, our method relies on ex post panel construction, and hence can be used to study unanticipated or otherwise inaccessible events. We conclude that despite the well known limitations of social media, their ""always on"" nature and their widespread availability offer an important source of public opinion data.",Twitter; social movements; social networks; ex post panels,WOS,,,,,,,,

We explore the utility of a tactical approach for explaining the movement's pace of insurgency. We employ a conceptual repertoire focused upon the political process model's core concepts of tactical innovation and tactical adaptations. We supplement these older concepts with the recently proposed concept of tactical freeze and propose an additional concept of tactical hashtags. We gather as a dataset through text-mining techniques the Instagram posts of the movement's founder and the reactions of people to those posts. The data include the number of posts, ""likes,"" and comments in response to movement hashtags created between 2015 and 2019. We conclude that the movement's emergence and early growth were enhanced by its tactical innovations, which heavily relied on hashtag activism. We discover that a specific type of hashtag-tactical hashtags-was of particular importance. The movement was unsuccessful, however, in changing the government's pro-hijab policy. In its tactical adaptations, the government passed more hijab regulations and stiffened penalties for resistance. The movement was undercut by these tactical adaptations and by a tactical freeze wherein it failed to develop tactical innovations capable of surmounting government repression.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICS; PROTEST; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; NETWORK ANALYSIS; TWITTER; REPRESSION; OPPORTUNITY; WOMENS,WOS,,,,,,,,

Each SNS varies somewhat, with different forms of expression, communication and customization. Different sites may have different priorities, methods of interacting, social features and definitions of what it means to be 'social' on their sites. Methodology/approach: This paper reports on 2 months of exploratory observations and interviews with participants using two of the most popular SNSs; Facebook.com and Twitter.com. Paying attention to the modal nuances of the sites and their effect on social interaction and identity portrayal, the focus of analysis is upon how these two sites are interacted with as 'stages' for identity performances, and how the varying aspects of design and modality on these interactive sites can result in different multimodal identity performances and social interactions. Findings: Data revealed that youth are adeptly able to negotiate the different modal options presented to them online, yet the temporal aspects presented by the design of the site, the differing definitions and priorities in the framing of identity presented by the SNSs, and the modal choices present across the two sites resulted in markedly differing presentations of identity to markedly differing audiences. Originality/value: This research demonstrates the impact of modality and design on how we act and interact, and highlights that as Digital Sociologists and Researchers, we should be careful not to treat all Online SNSs the same, but pay attention to the plethora of nuances these sites offer as stages for identity performances.

This review presents what is currently known about the way climate change is discussed on Twitter, acknowledging advantages and limitations and suggesting future areas for study. As an accessible platform, Twitter allows public expression of opinions on climate change and provides data on how these fluctuate over different times and places. Moving forward, studies assessing climate views can be improved by better linking them to demographic and other data indicating the population that Twitter users represent. The open‐ended content of tweets provides additional information, such as which topics are associated with climate change and which terms are used to discuss it. Future studies can build on these results to capture a wider range of climate‐related discussion. Finally, researchers are using Twitter to understand who initiates and participates in climate change dialog and how, by categorizing users as different actors—such as politicians, celebrities, NGOs, or the general public. Future research could consider how effective these efforts are, and how Twitter activity translates to offline outcomes.

This essay explores social science claims about the relationship between social networking and social movements. It examines research done on the relationship between social networking, the promotion of activism, and the offline participation in the streets. Can the technology of social networking help activists to achieve their goals? If so, is it just one of many tools they may use, or is the technology so powerful that the right use will actually tip the scales in favor of the social movement? This scholarship divides into optimistic, pessimistic, and ambivalent approaches, turning on an oft-repeated question: will the revolution be tweeted?

1907,journalArticle,2011.0,"Fuchs, Christian","Teaching and Learning Guide for: New Media, Web 2.0 and Surveillance.",Sociology Compass,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=66588533&site=ehost-live,"This guide accompanies the following article: Christian Fuchs, 'New Media, Web 2.0 and Surveillance', Sociology Compass 5/2 (2011): 134-147, [DOI]. Introduction The Internet has become part of our everyday lives. Many of us use it for work, hobbies, entertainment, politics, staying in touch with friends and family, learning to know new people and other cultures, for getting all kind of information, etc. In the past 10 years, we have seen the emergence of platforms like Facebook and Myspace (social networking sites), Wordpress and Blogger (blogging) Twitter (social networking, microblogging), YouTube (video sharing), Wikipedia (wiki-based encyclopaedia), or the Pirate Bay (filesharing index site). The notions of 'web 2.0' and 'social media' have been used by some scholars to describe features of such sites such as community-building and maintenance, continuous communication, user-generated content production and diffusion, collaborative authoring, and distributed content classifications (the latter mechanism is also called folksonomy). Most web 2.0 platforms collect, store, and share a lot of personal user data and data about usage behaviour. Therefore, questions about privacy violations and online surveillance have arisen in public discussions, especially concerning Google (for example the discussions about Google targeted advertising, Google Street View, Google Buzz, etc.) and Facebook (for example the discussions concerning Facebook targeted advertising, Facebook beacon, the Facebook privacy policy, Facebook places, etc.). The field of web 2.0 surveillance studies critically asks questions about the data protection aspects and power dimensions of the contemporary Internet. It is crucial for students and scholars, who are interested in the contemporary media landscape, and who study in fields such as media/communication studies, cultural studies, political science, law, computer science, social informatics, information science, sociology, business studies, advertising, marketing and public relations, philosophy, ethics, science and technology studies etc., to also engage with web 2.0 surveillance studies. Recommended readings Fuchs, Christian. 2010. 'Labour in Informational Capitalism and on the Internet'. The Information Society 26(3): 179-96. doi: Christian Fuchs discusses in this article the political economy of the contemporary Internet. He does so by giving first an introduction to Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism that is then applied for understanding aspects of the exploitation of the users of contemporary commercial Internet platforms like Facebook. Fuchs uses Dallas Smythe's notion of the audience commodity for critically discussing the business models of web 2.0. He coins the notion of Internet prosumer labour in this context. He concludes that on commercial web 2.0 platforms, user activity tends to become exploited and is unpaid labour. Surveillance is situated in the framework of this analysis. Andrejevic, Mark. 2002. 'The Work of Being Watched'. Critical Studies in Media Communication 19(2): 230-48. doi: Mark Andrejevic argues in this article that contemporary commercial forms of interactive media make use of surveillance for exploiting consumers. He introduces in this context the notion of 'the work of being watched'. This concept is based on Sut Jhally's concept of the work of watching. Andrejevic also introduces the notion of the digital enclosure and gives very good examples for online surveillance. Albrechtslund, Anders. 2008. 'Online Social Networking as Participatory Surveillance'. First Monday 13(3). [online]. Retrieved on 1 March 2011 from: . In this article, Anders Albrechtslund introduces the notion of participatory surveillance. Other than Fuchs and Andrejevic, Albrechtslund has a rather positive concept of surveillance, he focuses on the description of potentially empowering aspects of social networking sites and other web 2.0 technologies. Albrechtslund stresses the social dimension of web 2.0, its ability for enabling communication, sharing, and community-building. Mathiesen, Thomas. 2004. Silently Silenced. Essays on the Creation of Acquiescence in Modern Society. Winchester: Waterside Press. In this short 100 page book, Thomas Mathiesen discusses mechanisms and examples of how political opposition is silently silenced, that is ideologically forestalled. The work is a masterpiece of contemporary ideology critique. Mathiesen identifies mechanisms of how silent silencing works and gives many examples. In chapter 8, it is discussed how the corporate Internet works as system of silent silencing or what Mathiesen terms the synopticon. Mathiesen's work is influenced among others by Foucault and Frankfurt School ideology critique. Campbell, John E. and Matt, Carlson M. 2002. 'Panopticon.com: Online Surveillance and the Commodification of Privacy'. Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media 46(4): 586-606. doi: In this paper, Campbell and Carlson discuss the usefulness of Michel Foucault's notion of the panopticon as technology of surveillance for explaining how Internet advertising and marketing work. They employ a political economy framework and argue that Internet advertising and marketing commodify users' private data and their privacy.

This review presents what is currently known about the way climate change is discussed on Twitter, acknowledging advantages and limitations and suggesting future areas for study. As an accessible platform, Twitter allows public expression of opinions on climate change and provides data on how these fluctuate over different times and places. Moving forward, studies assessing climate views can be improved by better linking them to demographic and other data indicating the population that Twitter users represent. The open-ended content of tweets provides additional information, such as which topics are associated with climate change and which terms are used to discuss it. Future studies can build on these results to capture a wider range of climate-related discussion. Finally, researchers are using Twitter to understand who initiates and participates in climate change dialog and how, by categorizing users as different actorssuch as politicians, celebrities, NGOs, or the general public. Future research could consider how effective these efforts are, and how Twitter activity translates to offline outcomes.",SOCIAL MEDIA; TWEETS; CHANGE COMMUNICATION; DISASTER; FRAMES; OPINIONS; RESPONSES; TYPHOON HAIYAN; US; WEATHER,WOS,,,,,,,,

Given the ""many-to-many"" dynamic that alternative journalism via social media offers in contrast to the ""one-to-many"" approach of traditional media, there are implications for incursions into more democratic, participatory cultures and structures. Existing literature indicates that user-generated content via social media potentially is known to supplant traditional journalism in protest situations due to advantages such as first-hand access. Further, research demonstrates that activist reporting supplements and integrates with traditional journalism, and that interdependence develops.

Despite the ubiquity of the mobile phone, the cultural impact of the mobile phone in and of itself has not been a major topic within the sociology of culture. To this end, there are two goals of this paper. First, three common uses of the mobile phone are presented. To separate cultural practices associated with mobile phones from practices associated with other domains of social life, the term digital practices is used. Second, this paper will discuss the domestication of technology approach, and its applicability to the study of mobile phones. Identifying practices and providing a framework for interpreting these practices can help scholars interested in theorizing and teaching the cultural (as opposed to economic or technological) aspects of mobile telephony.",CONSUMPTION; TEXT; TWITTER; PROSUMPTION,WOS,,,,,,,,

They can shape the context in which journalists see and frame the events. The relationship between journalists and their sources during conflicts has received extensive scholarly analysis over the last three decades. This paper addresses the characteristics of this relationship by discussing the power balance between the two sides and presenting a typology of traditional and new news sources used during conflict coverage. Two major trends are concluded: (1) The power dynamics between journalists and news sources during conflict and crisis times are changing and becoming more complex, as sources are more able to influence the news and the boundary between them and journalists are becoming more blurred in today's global digital media environment. (2) New faces and sources are included in news stories, such as terrorists, enemy leaders, and ordinary citizens, enriching the audience with alternative views on the conflict. Although both trends suggest a decrease of dependence on official sources, journalists still rely most on such sources, which maintain some of their control over news flow during conflict.",TECHNOLOGY; PATTERNS; POWER; FRAME; TWITTER; PUBLIC-RELATIONS; ASSESSMENTS; EXPERTS; INTERVIEW; NEWS-MEDIA,WOS,,,,,,,,

Since her early theorization, popular culture and social scientists have adopted the term to refer to emotion work that is exhibited in a manner of financially compensated social settings. Emotional labor refers to the process by which individuals are expected to conform to a set of societal guidelines, ensuring that their emotions conform to that performance. As the use of social media grows, emotional labor plays an increasing role in the lives of people of color-across media platforms. We frame the ever-present negotiation involved in racialized interactions online as a type of uncompensated emotional labor that results in racial battle fatigue. Next, we position emotional labor as an intrinsic part of the experience for social media users of color because digital media is by default a White, racialized space. Lastly, we argue that current research on civility does not account for the emotional labor of people of color. We offer an original view of uncompensated emotional labor that is inclusive of cross-platform, racialized emotional labor that can result in racial battle fatigue.",ONLINE; RACE; INCIVILITY; AGE; DISCRIMINATION; TWITTER; ALLIES; EXPERIENCE; CIVILITY; ROLES,WOS,,,,,,,,

Ignorance is socially constructed, negotiated, and pervasive; ignorance is often socially inevitable, even necessary; and, without a doubt, ignorance is socially consequential. Yet, despite its significance, ignorance has appeared a largely secondary concern among sociologists. Perhaps more perplexing, while sociologists of racism, power, and domination have long focused on the ways racial ideologies distort and mystify racial understanding to sustain White supremacy over time, we have done less to elaborate ignorance than is possible and warranted. Here, I join growing calls for a fully-fledged sociology of ignorance and argue that antiracist and decolonial scholars have much to gain from and contribute to such an endeavor. This article traces the historical forebears of a sociology of ignorance and explores ignorance as a social concept before turning to examine precedents and increasing attention to ignorance scholarship on racism, racial domination, and racialized non-knowing. Drawing from this work, I urge race-critical scholars take advantage of our unique position to advance theory and methodology surrounding ignorance and the social-cultural production of non-knowledge as a broader area of social inquiry.",CONSTRUCTION; GENDER; RACE; KNOWLEDGE; INEQUALITY; STUDENTS; TWITTER; APARTHEID; PLURALISTIC IGNORANCE; WHITE IGNORANCE,WOS,,,,,,,,

In this research, the authors situate Black Twitter within the public sphere-counterpublic literature and ask the question: can Black Twitter be understood as a counterpublic? The authors compare Black Twitter, as indicated by the #BlackTwitter hashtag, with hashtags indicating the public sphere-#TCOT (Top Conservatives on Twitter) for conservatives and #UniteBlue for progressives-and with a hashtag indicating another potential counterpublic-#BCOT (Black Conservatives on Twitter). Using a corpus of 16,000 tweets collected during a 10-day period, comparisons were made in interaction patterns (tweets, favorites, and replies) and thematic content.

This article is not intended to provide empirical evidence or a fully formed theoretical understanding of Twitter, but rather to provide a selected literature review and a set of directions for sociologists.

This advances scholarship that relies too heavily on content analysis to support judgements about news representations of Muslims. I use examples from original fieldwork in Glasgow to discuss the capital, autonomy and heteronomy of Muslim sources who are 'authorised knowers' and 'new entrants' in their source communities. These various positions are evident in their relative success in managing journalist-source relations, which encompass 'legacy' media platforms and emerging communication tools such as Twitter.

We find that cities cluster into three distinct types ('Coastal', 'Transitional' and 'Heartland') and that geographic proximity together with race, education and language associate with this clustering. Specifically, we found that clusters of Blacker cities tend to tweet more per capita, but also that more highly educated cities tend to tweet less per capita.

Institutionalist theories of social control suggest that such interventions can be efficacious if they are perceived as legitimate, whereas theories of psychological reactance suggest that users may instead ratchet up aggressive behavior in response to the sanctioning authority. In a sample of 3.6 million tweets spanning one month before and one month after Twitter’s policy change, the authors find evidence of a modest positive shift in the average sentiment of tweets with slurs targeting women and/or African Americans. The authors further illustrate this trend by tracking the network spread of specific tweets and individual users. Retweeted messages are more negative than those not forwarded.

Our crowdsourced validation shows that commercial image recognition systems can produce labels that are correct and biased at the same time as they selectively report a subset of many possible true labels. We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men.

In conducting an analysis of 240 tweets, memes, and political cartoons from the 2016 U.S. presidential election targeting the two frontrunners, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we see how popular political humor often reaffirmed heteronormative assumptions of gender, sexuality, and race and equated scripts of hegemonic masculinity with presidential ability.

Second, they show that backlash against mask refusal, rather than mask refusal itself, was the primary way masks were discussed in relation to national electoral, governmental, and partisan themes.",UNITED-STATES; coronavirus; face masks; affective polarization; media analysis; POLITICAL POLARIZATION; political symbols,WOS,,,,,,,,

Consistent with the perceived characteristics of a digitized culture in political participation, 'rhizomorphic' behaviour is observed (see Lim 2017, pp. 217-23) and further examined in this study--undertaken fifteen years later, in 2020--following the country's first ever regime change in the 2018 general elections (GE14). Referencing Deleuze and Guattari's (1987, pp. 3-25) 'schizoanalysis', this study sheds light on how Malaysian youths creatively and purposefully deterritorialize and reterritorialize their political desires. Specifically, this paper observes the political mediascape post-GE14 via a database from Malaysia's 'Twitter-verse' and a collective of civil society groups (e.g., Projek Dialog, Warga Dunia, Borneo Komrad) in order to substantiate the idea of a 'digital rhizomorph'. The digital rhizomorph is defined in this study as a body of contemporary youth politics that are more experimental and collaborative than hierarchical in character. The digital rhizomorph offers a more nuanced understanding of the original concept of the 'rhizome', often reflecting and morphing based on several key factors identified in the fieldwork.

We reviewed the literature of framing analysis in relation to social media, virtual communities and social movements to present a brief overview of the practical and theoretical potentials of frame analysis and also the particularities and problems that arose in regard to the dynamic nature of social media. As a result, frame analysis presents an even broader potential for the research of dynamic communication processes in the fast lives of virtual communities and the vast effects of online interaction of social, political, commercial institutions.

With the example of four South Asian youth organisations and their activities in the United States, this article tries to examine how these organisations reinforce the youth identities by forming virtual networks based on single or multiple affiliations. Use of the social media by these youth organisations – whether sharing information about various socio-cultural and educational events in the Facebook or using the online hashtag in Twitter to raise awareness and mobilisation on subtle issues or creating blogs on various innovative projects and connecting them with their official webpages – is one of the important hallmarks that distinguish them from the traditional diasporic youth organisations.

The research methodology incorporates the technology acceptance paradigm and a model of technology adoption and usage. The survey was developed, checked for accuracy, and released to the public. According to the results, students' usage of social networking sites affects their confidence in their capacity to succeed and their desire to do so. These results have real-world and theoretical ramifications for policymakers and entrepreneurial education, such as using widely used yet cutting-edge communication and Internet tools to inspire young people to start their own businesses. In this analysis, we test the hypothesis that there is a connection between the time spent on social networking sites (SNS) and measures of confidence in, and desire for, starting one's own business. Over two hundred and fifty female students from Private Universities in Bangladesh participated in online questionnaires and correlation tests. More time spent on social networking sites is correlated with more serious business thinking and behavior. Students of all sexes and all ages use Facebook, but younger students and women in particular associate the platform with entrepreneurial aspirations and attitudes more strongly than their male counterparts. There is a greater understanding of the relationship between social media presence and entrepreneurship factors because to this research. The researchers sorted the interviewees' responses into four groups based on their findings: how often they used SNS, how much they felt supported by SNS, how secure they felt in their entrepreneurial conduct, and how ambitious they wanted to be as business owners' Important motifs were also determined for each class. Institutions of higher learning may and should use social media to promote and educate aspiring business owners.

Participants were invited to follow one of the Twitter accounts of nine candidates from the main political parties during the 2019 European Parliament electoral campaign in Spain. Experiment compliance among participants was confirmed using web-tracking data (passive metre). The results show that exposure to candidates' Twitter accounts by self-selection does not increase affective polarisation. Although high levels of polarisation might contribute to building echo chambers, the polarising content contained in the partisan Twitter accounts has no effect on increasing affective polarisation, even among those who strongly identify with such parties. This finding confirms the so-called limited media effect hypothesis for social media.

Wael Ghonim, a prominent activist in the revolution, proclaimed, ""If you want to free a society, just give them Internet access."" The virtual-physical hybrid protest is becoming the new paradigm in political discourse and action around the world. But can Internet access equal political access, and if so, what role is left for physical public space? This paper will examine the requirements democracy places on the public sphere, and explore the capacities of virtual and physical space with respect to these requirements. Nancy Fraser's theories of the public demonstrate that political discourse has different spatial needs depending on the stage of development. Subaltern-counterpublics need low access and visibility for withdrawal and regroupment, but high access and visibility to successfully disseminate their message. Protests in Cairo, Egypt and Seattle, Washington have shown that the speed and horizontal structure of virtual public space fills the needs of the first stage effectively. However, when political discourse moves into wider arenas, virtual space is not enough. The symbolism, imagery, and phenomenological experience of physical space play a more important role in effecting awareness and change. Despite the power of social media, effective political action must still go out into the square.

We identify three frames used to interpret the altercation: (1) Condemning Hunt or violence against women; (2) Vindicating Hunt through victim-blaming, downplaying the incident or providing gendered and racial justifications; and (3) Contextualizing the altercation by considering consequences linked to NFL policies and the role of tabloid media sensationalism. We find that commenters often use 'soft' racial and sexist framings to assess Hunt's culpability. We conclude by discussing the broader implications surrounding media representations of and online reactions to violence against women by racialized athletes.","NEWS; SOCIAL MEDIA; social media; PARTICIPATION; violence against women; NFL; race; RACE; TWITTER; SPORTS; BLACK; AGGRESSION; FOOTBALL; BRYANT,KOBE; sports scandal",WOS,,,,,,,,

The course was organized using recommendations from the occupational socialization theory literature. Participants were 22 preservice teachers enrolled in the course. The preservice teachers were organized into groups of three and engaged in peer teaching before beginning a junior high school early field experience. Reflective practices were incorporated throughout the course including Twitter chats prompting PTs to examine their beliefs regarding the field of physical education. Data were collected using five qualitative methods and analyzed using analytic induction and constant comparison. Data analysis led to the development of three themes: (a) becoming aware of the realities of and changes needed within physical education; (b) reconsidering what it means to teach physical education; and (c) course organization and experiences opened the PTs to challenging their subjective theories. The preservice teachers recognized issues within the field of physical education and difficulties physical educators face as well as the ability of the physical educators to work with and support youth beyond their coaching roles. In doing so, they exhibited a shift from coaching to balanced orientations. Changes were facilitated through the development of relationships with the instructor and peers, reflection, and field experience. Findings provide evidence in support of recommendations for integrating occupational socialization theory into teacher education program development. Further, Twitter can be a useful tool for enhancing reflective practices particularly when teacher educators support preservice teachers as they develop more nuanced understandings of physical education.

Consequently, this paper positions teachers prior interest with social media acts as a type of ‘leverage’ for using sites such as Facebook and Twitter for professional learning purposes. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore how social media operates as a communicative space, external to the physical site of an emerging community of practice (CoP) that supported teachers' professional learning and their subsequent longer term changing practice. This study is nested within a wider longitudinal project that explores how teachers learnt and refined their use of a pedagogical innovation (Cooperative Learning) through the overarching methodology, participatory action research. Social media emerged as a form of communication that was not in the study's original design. The paper explores 2125 interactions, through Facebook and Twitter, between five physical education teachers and a facilitator over a two-year period. Through social media, the facilitator re-enforced teachers changing practice, aided the development of the practices of an emerging CoP, and by the CoP situating their use of the innovation in the virtual world, teachers were supported in changing their practice over time, and the use of the pedagogical innovation was sustained. Interactions promoted teacher inquiry, challenged teachers to develop their existing use of the innovation further and encouraged them to work together and develop shared practices. Therefore, social media is presented here as a ‘new’ method for professional learning that supports pedagogical change and overcomes some of the financial and time implications of facilitators and teachers working together.

This research sought to understand how PE teachers interpret PL. We investigated teacher's conceptualisations, understandings, practices, and ideas of 'what' PL stands for through a #Chat conversation with physical educators on Twitter. This generated qualitative data that were interpretively analysed. An 'everyday philosophy' of PL emerged from the physical educators' relationship with the PL concept, alongside the notion that some use social media as a PL advocacy tool. A lack of sophistication was evident in the PE teachers understanding and operationalization of PL. We conclude that perhaps too much time and effort has been spent 'adapting' PL to national contexts, personal, and institutional agendas, rather than investing in the pedagogical and content knowledge of PE teachers to deliver on the concept of PL. We suggest that it is empirical research rather than academic opinionating that is needed to establish the validity of PL for PE.

We argue that these platforms provide user-generated archives in the sense that they are built by users who document their everyday life by uploading items (photographs, videos, graphics, texts) which they either created themselves or which they accessed somewhere and made available by uploading them. By engaging with literature on archival science as well as on social media platforms, we discuss the opportunities which come along with the emergence of these new archives but also the ethical challenges that need to be faced when using sources from these online platforms. The article also engages with practical considerations on how to access, store and cite these sources.

This research evaluates whether a new rhetoric that encourages the development of a peace culture has replaced the ideological rhetoric of various social actors involved in dialog and negotiations to end the armed conflict between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People's Army (FARC-EP). To this end, a textual analysis of the ideological rhetoric disseminated through Twitter® by several actors in Colombian society was conducted to identify the expressions used (semantic analysis) to legitimize or delegitimize those involved in the conflict in the last negotiation year (2016).

Using a snowball method, the 59 starter accounts were used to collect data about the most popular accounts in the network-at-large. Social network analysis on the data collated about Twitter users in the Western Syria-based fighters points to the controlling role played by feeder accounts belonging to terrorist organizations in the insurgency zone, and by Europe-based organizational accounts associated with the banned British organization, Al Muhajiroun, and in particular the London-based preacher, Anjem Choudary.

However, rather than relying on centralized servers owned and maintained by a single firm, Twister users operate a blockchain combined with distributed hash table (DHT)–like and BitTorrent-like protocols to both make posts and send private messages, and also to receive entries from other users. Twister's raison d'etre is that it offers a social networking platform that cannot be censored and cannot itself censor. The software does not record the Internet Protocol addresses users use to access the service, nor does it notify other users of an account's online/offline status. Growing adoption of blockchain services means that it is possible that the concept of decentralized social networks could become a norm. It is suggested in this article that blockchain-based peer-to-peer social networks present challenges to the current counterextremist practices for content removal and censorship. While there are methods to disrupt usage of blockchain-based peer-to-peer services, these approaches may have the net harm of curtailing bona fide use of legal and novel technologies.

The chapter argues that researchers should reflexively consider the ways in which data collection techniques framed as 'passive' actively impact on researchers' emotional lifeworlds. Consequently, it is important to ensure that researchers are adequately prepared and supported. Methodology/Approach - The data introduced in this chapter were constructed around a single case study. This example documents an incident where a woman was asked to leave a sports shop in the UK because she was breastfeeding. Not allowing breastfeeding within a business is illegal in the UK, and this case resulted in a protest. The study involved an analysis of user-generated data from an online news site and Twitter. Findings - Drawing on field notes and conversations with colleagues, the chapter explores the value of reflexivity for successfully managing researchers' emotional responses to disturbing data during the process of analysis. Originality/Value - Whilst the role of emotion is often considered as part of ethnographic practice in studies utilising face-to-face encounters, it is underexplored in the online domain. This chapter presents, through a detailed example, a reflective account of the emotion work required in participant absent research, and offers strategies to reflexively manage emotions.

Social penetration theory (Altman and Taylor 1973) is used to investigate the ways that Twitter provides a platform to technologically augment friendship evolution. Three consecutive phases of online surveillance are proposed, which are: unidirectional 'studied' following; 'reciprocal' following, when interaction between the user and the Tweeter only occurs online; and fully fledged friendship, when online relations are supplemented by offline meetings. The visibility of users via their Tweets creates information that others can use to evaluate character in what might be considered a phase of pre-friendship screening; this information also generates trust and solidarity prior to an offline meeting. Perceived similarity between the user and the Tweeter was contributory to an assessment of their worth as a potential friend. Geographic proximity and 'transferable trust' were also factors that helped offline friendship to develop. Ultimately, Twitter was an important tool for sociality, and provided a wider source of potential friends than was available offline.

Ubiquitous visual technologies, the possibility to distribute and use images from heterogeneous sources across different social contexts and publics, and increasingly powerful facial recognition tools afford new avenues for law enforcement. Concurrently, these changes also trigger fundamental concerns about privacy violations and all-encompassing surveillance. Using the example of police investigations after the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, the present article provides insights into how different actors in the political and public realm in Germany deal with these potentials and tensions in handling visual data. Based on a qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles (n=42), tweets (n=267), experts’ reports (n=3), and minutes of parliamentary debates and committee hearings (n=8), this study examines how visual data were collected, analyzed, and published and how different actors legitimated and contested these practices. The findings show that combined state, corporate, and privately produced visual data and the use of facial recognition tools allowed the police to cover and track public life in large parts of the inner city of Hamburg during the summit days. Police authorities characterized visual data and algorithmic tools as objective, trustworthy, and indispensable evidence-providing tools but black-boxed the heterogeneity of sources, the analytical steps, and their potential implications. Critics, in turn, expressed concerns about infringements of civic rights, the trustworthiness of police authorities, and the extensive police surveillance capacities. Based on these findings, this article discusses three topics that remained blind spots in the debates but merit further attention in discussions on norms for visual data management and for governing visibility: (1) collective responsibilities in visibility management, (2) trust in visual data and facial recognition technologies, and (3) social consequences of encompassing visual data collection and registered faceprints.

Yet the focus of conversations about data ethics has centered on computer scientists, engineers, and designers, with far less attention paid to the digital practices of artists and others in the cultural sector. Artists have historically deployed new technologies in unexpected and often prescient ways, making them a community able to speak directly to the changing and nuanced ethical questions faced by those who use data and machine learning systems. We conducted interviews with thirty-three artists working with digital data, with a focus on how artists prefigure and commonly challenge data practices and ethical concerns of computer scientists, researchers, and the wider population. We found artists were frequently working to produce a sense of defamiliarization and critical distance from contemporary digital technologies in their audiences. The ethics of using large-scale data and AI systems for these artists were generally developed in ongoing conversations with other practitioners in their communities and in relation to a longer history of art practice.

Successful gamification practices are reliant on encouraging playful subjectivities so that users voluntarily expose their personal information, which is then used to drive behavioural change (e.g. weight loss, workplace productivity, educational advancement, consumer loyalty, etc.). The pleasures of play, the promise of a 'game', and the desire to level up and win are used to inculcate desirable skill sets and behaviours. Gamification is rooted in surveillance; providing real-time feedback about users' actions by amassing large quantities of data and then simplifying this data into modes that easily understandable, such as progress bars, graphs and charts. This article provides an introduction to gamification for surveillance scholars. I first provide brief definitions of gamification, games and play, linking the effectiveness of gamification to the quantification of everyday life. I then explain how the quantification in gamification is different from the quantification in both analog spaces and digital non-game spaces. Next, I draw from governmentality studies to show how quantification is leveraged in terms of surveillance. I employ three examples to demonstrate the social effects and impacts of gamified behaviour. These examples range from using self-surveillance to gamify everyday life, to the participatory surveillance evoked by social networking services, to the hierarchical surveillance of the gamified call-centre. Importantly, the call-centre example becomes a limit case, emphasizing the inability to gamify all spaces, especially those framed by work and not play. This leads to my conclusion, arguing that without knowing first what games and play are, we cannot accurately respond to and critique the playful surveillant technologies leveraged by gamification.

This paper argues that closely examining content created by others and looking at one's own content through other people's eyes, a common part of social media use, should be framed as social surveillance. While social surveillance is distinguished from traditional surveillance along three axes (power, hierarchy, and reciprocity), its effects and behavior modification is common to traditional surveillance. Drawing on ethnographic studies of United States populations, I look at social surveillance, how it is practiced, and its impact on people who engage in it. I use Foucault's concept of capillaries of power to demonstrate that social surveillance assumes the power differentials evident in everyday interactions rather than the hierarchical power relationships assumed in much of the surveillance literature. Social media involves a collapse of social contexts and social roles, complicating boundary work but facilitating social surveillance. Individuals strategically reveal, disclose and conceal personal information to create connections with others and tend social boundaries. These processes are normal parts of day-to-day life in communities that are highly connected through social media.

It is therefore important to understand the economic organization of these platforms. The discussion of surveillance in web 2.0 is important because such platforms collect huge amounts of personal data in order to work. In this paper, first the example of Google Buzz is discussed. Next, a model that conceptualizes the cycle of capital accumulation and distinguishes between production and circulation of capital is introduced, after which the role of surveillance in web 2.0 is outlined based on the cycle of capital accumulation. The notions of the Internet prosumer commodity and web 2.0 surveillance are introduced in order to characterize the relationship of production, consumption, and surveillance on web 2.0.

Increased integration of sensors into infrastructure systems, combined with modern computational capabilities, provides an opportunity to develop novel data-driven methods for improving resilience. Social media serves as a promising data source for such methods, as it has become widely used for information dissemination. This paper aims to demonstrate the value of social media for CI resilience by using this novel data source to model CI behaviors at higher spatiotemporal resolutions than previously shown. We apply this approach, which focuses on statistical analysis and forecasting methods, to a case study of Hurricane Sandy using publicly available Twitter data and power system data for the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). We find evidence of statistically significant correlations between Twitter and power system data, and develop models for forecasting future behaviors in the NYISO power system using these data.

While the speed of the Associated Press hack crash event and the proprietary nature of the algorithms involved make it difficult to make causal claims about the relationship between social media and trading algorithms, we argue that it helps us to critically examine the volatile connections between social media, financial markets, and third parties offering human and algorithmic analysis. By analyzing the commentaries of this event, we highlight two particular currents: one formed by computational processes that mine and analyze Twitter data, and the other being financial algorithms that make automated trades and steer the stock market. We build on sociology of finance together with media theory and focus on the work of Christian Marazzi, Gabriel Tarde and Tony Sampson to analyze the relationship between social media and financial markets. We argue that Twitter and social media are becoming more powerful forces, not just because they connect people or generate new modes of participation, but because they are connecting human communicative spaces to automated computational spaces in ways that are affectively contagious and highly volatile.

In the second part, the authors argue that in anthropology and social philosophy the term ‘gift’ has often been used improperly, and that gift exchange has nothing to do with goods exchange, but with mutual recognition. In the third part, they use this definition to stress the importance of gift circulation through Facebook’s ‘Like’ button and the Twitter feature called ‘Mention’. In conclusion, the authors deal with the ‘Like economy’, i.e. the interference between gift exchange and market economy which is daily at work online.

These tasks are performed through particular ways of acting, dressing, talking, eating, and the like, in public. Social media has become a key locus for bodily self-presentation because it is used to create the appearance of intimacy and spontaneity through the distribution of 'candid' pictures and videos. This paper will analyze how the self-presentation of populist and non-populist leaders are established through Twitter, what images they choose to disseminate, and how they are re-signified by the audience.

We call this specific type of representative linkage 'synecdochal representation'. In it, the leader's body performs three key functions: it mirrors certain popular traits that are characterized as 'low', it displays marks of exceptionality, and it appropriates symbols of institutional power. These tasks are performed through particular ways of acting, dressing, talking, eating, and the like, in public. Social media has become a key locus for bodily self-presentation because it is used to create the appearance of intimacy and spontaneity through the distribution of 'candid' pictures and videos. This paper will analyze how the self-presentation of populist and non-populist leaders are established through Twitter, what images they choose to disseminate, and how they are re-signified by the audience. To do so, we will focus on the two Latin American politicians: Cristina Fernandez (with a populist style) and Mauricio Macri (with a technocratic one).",social media; populism; bodily self-presentation; populist leadership; populist representation,WOS,,,,,,,,

This paper discusses how corporate social media are related to the capitalist organization of time and the changes this organization is undergoing. It uses social theory for conceptualizing changes of society and its time regime and how these changes shape social media. These changes have been described with notions such as prosumption, consumption labour, play labour (playbour) and digital labour. The paper contextualizes digital labour on social media with the help of a model of society that distinguishes three subsystems (the economy, politics, culture) and three forms of power (economic, political, culture). In modern society, these systems are based on the logic of the accumulation of power and the acceleration of accumulation. The paper discusses the role of various dimensions of time in capitalism with the help of a model that is grounded in Karl Marx’s works. It points out the importance of the category of time for a labour theory of value and a digital labour theory of value. Social media are expressions of the changing time regimes that modern society has been undergoing, especially in relation to the blurring of leisure and labour time (play labour), production and consumption time (prosumption), new forms of absolute and relative surplus value production, the acceleration of consumption with the help of targeted online advertising and the creation of speculative, future-oriented forms of fictitious capital.

Thus, this article aims to characterize these elements in festivals’ VBCs through a multidimensional analysis of nearly 2150 entries in the Twitter and Facebook VBCs of one of the most prominent music festivals in Europe, Sónar (Barcelona). Moreover, it does so through a longitudinal observation covering a whole year, showing the relevance of ongoing communication to festival success.

The most important infrastructural element of this information society is the internet which enables dissemination of information in a very efficient and effective way, independent from the physical proximity between two networked computers. The internet is nonhierarchical (horizontal) in the sense that it does not have an ultimate power center which determines the structure of the networks and the contents that flow within and between networks. The formation of the networks and the content of information disseminated through them are shaped by the users. Hence, the interplay between internet and individuals is bidirectional; individuals structure the networks and the structure of networks, in turn, shapes the perception of individuals regarding self, community, and time. This paper analyzes how and why people use Twitter—both a social networking site and a micro-blogger; to what extent Twitter use reflect the constituting principles of contemporary society such as conception of time and how it may affect our notion of community and social relations. It argues that Twitter represents a replica of hypermodern society with the apprehension of time streaming embedded in its use, clustering of users around personal and professional communities and centers and the strategies that users develop in order to deal with the complexity of online hypermodernity. Twitter, and social network sites in general, are structured by the values and conceptions of the contemporary society and we need to consider them within a greater zeitgeist. The main function of these services is to reinforce and enhance the conceptions and experience of hypermodernity and to increase the rate of social change further.

The results show that candidates did not use social media to portray their personal side, humanise their image and create their image of a leader through references to their skills and qualities. Rather, this research shows that in spite of the growing importance of social media, and the willingness and skill of the politicians in employing social media, traditional media, such as newspapers, remain indispensable for providing information about political issues to citizens in this new democracy during presidential elections.

Mayors operate in both spaces simultaneously (i.e., politics and administration), yet little has been reported about how they balance these positions online. This article examines (1) the extent to which mayors who govern the 100 largest U.S. cities form ties with each other, (2) the messages they create, and (3) the factors that influence their associations. Content analysis identifies common message types, including favorable presentation, symbolic acts, and political positioning statements. Results from quadratic assignment procedure indicate mayors form ties with high-profile counterparts from the same political party who represent larger cities and possess more followers (i.e., more popular accounts). The findings suggest tie formation has less to do with the exchange of best practices—as in policy networks—and more to do with self-promotion and political marketing to constituents at home.

In cities, urban green spaces are believed to provide many benefits to urban populations in terms of mental and emotional well-being. Through a case study of 60 urban green spaces in Birmingham, United Kingdom, this article investigates the spatial and temporal variation of the emotions experienced by individuals whilst using urban green spaces. Using a dataset obtained from Twitter as the basis for emotional explorations, sentiment analysis was performed on over 10,000 tweets to ascertain the positivity/negativity of individuals. Positive responses were more common than negative responses across all seasons, with happiness and appreciation of beauty being the common positive emotions identified. For the negative responses, fear and anger were present in similar amounts, with fewer tweets indicating sadness and disgust. Our findings show that Twitter data is a viable source of information to researchers investigating human interaction and emotional response to space in cities. Such information has implications for urban planners and park managers, enabling the creation of evidence-based spaces which enhance positive outdoor experience. Limitations in using Twitter data are discussed and these should be considered in future research.

However, contact between racial groups depends not merely on where people live, but also on where they travel over the course of everyday activities. To capture this reality, we propose a new measure of racial segregation – the segregated mobility index (SMI) – that captures the extent to which neighbourhoods of given racial compositions are connected to other types of neighbourhoods in equal measure. Based on hundreds of millions of geotagged tweets sent by over 375,000 Twitter users in the 50 largest US cities, we show that the SMI captures a distinct element of racial segregation, one that is related to, but not solely a function of, residential segregation. A city's racial composition also matters; minority group threat, especially in cities with large Black populations and a troubled legacy of racial conflict, appears to depress movement across neighbourhoods in ways that produce previously undocumented forms of racial segregation. Our index, which could be constructed using other data sources, expands the possibilities for studying dynamic forms of racial segregation including their effects and shifts over time.

For each timeframe, we evaluated word-combination frequencies (to understand the use of language) and social network structures (to understand which accounts were influential and how they interacted). We observed a change in the three time periods. Before the bicycling infrastructure was built, Twitter activity was focused on advocacy, which was especially strong in Victoria. The first riding season had the most social media activity, the most diverse perspectives and the most controversy. The second riding season held more support. Based on the Twitter activity, we found that Edmonton had more support from local businesses and traditional media, launching a connected network of infrastructure with less social media opposition. Our results suggest that attitudes associated with change in bicycling infrastructure may have a cycle, with initial negative responses to change, followed by an uptick in positive attitudes.

We asked this overarching question: What are user perceptions of security when logging in to third-party apps and services via existing Facebook, Google, and Twitter accounts? Drawing from approaches to researching technology from the sub-fields of human-computer interaction, user studies, visual and risk communication, while incorporating methodological techniques from psychology on mental models, we offer a methodological innovation.

Because Twitter data is often associated with latitude and longitude points, geospatial mapping of tweets that utilized the hashtag #MeToo to discuss experiences of sexual violence may be useful in understanding ways to best deliver resources to survivors who seek help online. Accordingly, the present study conducted an exploratory geographic information systems (GIS) ""hotspot"" (i.e., special cluster of tweet events) analysis to examine the feasibility of mapping tweets including the hashtag #MeToo with associated latitude and longitude data (N = 777) to target interventions and resource provision. Data indicated that tweets with the hashtag #MeToo were dispersed across the United States in a manner inconsistent with population density and that concentrated points emerged in other countries. Data suggest that certain geographic regions are more motivated to discuss sexual violence online and are perhaps in more dire need of violence-related resources. Future research should incorporate GIS analysis of larger Twitter datasets to target resource provision toward populations engaged in help-seeking online. GIS analysis of Twitter discourse surrounding gender-based violence may also be utilized by law enforcement, healthcare agencies, and academicians to develop targeted interventions.

Drawing upon ""what we don't know"" about the ways in which sexual assault disclosure occurs in online contexts, we generate suggestions for research, as well as strategies for understanding how best to create safer and more supportive experiences for survivors of sexual victimization who choose to disclose their experiences online.

2041,journalArticle,2020.0,"Taylor, Yvette; Breeze, Maddie",All imposters in the university? Striking (out) claims on academic Twitter.,Women's Studies International Forum,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=144567766&site=ehost-live,"This article extends feminist debates on academic labour and particularly career categories, exploring how ambivalent insider/outsider academic 'imposter' positions are performed and circulated on social media. We argue for a conceptual shift from imposter syndrome to imposter positionality via an empirical focus on how the UK 2018 Universities and Colleges Union industrial action played out on academic Twitter. We develop autoethnographic fictions as method, exploring the ethical dilemmas of doing feminist research online. Industrial action was fractured by categorical career stages; however, contested career categories are also mobilised by academics to claim an outsider-on-the-inside imposter position, which implies well-documented academic exclusions according to class, race, and gender while simultaneously glossing over and conflating such inequalities with, for instance, 'early career' status. Our argument is against the depoliticization of both imposter 'syndrome' and career stage categories, and rejects any search for the avowedly authentic academic imposter. Instead we attend to how imposter positionality is claimed and circulated online, across the career course, questioning the notion that we are 'all imposters' in the academy. • Extends contemporary feminist debates on academic labour and career categories • Argues for a conceptual shift from imposter syndrome to imposter positionality • Uses autoethnographic fictions as method for navigating ethics of Twitter research • Analyses how imposter positions are claimed via career stage in the context of strike action • Concludes that career categories imply but gloss e.g. class, race, gender inequalities [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",Social media; Racism; Feminists; Higher education; Academic Twitter; Career categories; Imposter positionality; Imposter syndrome; Impostors & imposture; Industrial action; Universities & colleges,SocIndex,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about how women are using social media during campaign periods in the global South setting. By focusing on the use of Instagram and Twitter in Indonesia, this study examines how elected female representatives used these platforms during the 2019 legislative elections. The findings suggest that female politicians are more inclined to use Instagram than Twitter because of the features on Instagram that are heavily reliant on visual materials. Furthermore, some politicians remain sceptical in weighing up the benefits of digital campaigning since the full display of their activities through social media might put their winning strategies at risk. This study offers important insights as to how women in non-Western societies are using social media by applying unique strategies and considerations.

During this time, stigma of COVID-19 patients had led to some people dying in their homes because they did not want to be seen seeking treatment and getting stigmatized in the process. The study examined stigma-marking of COVID-19 patients in Facebook and Twitter messages written by youth in Malaysia. A total of 100 messages were collected from the posts of young people in Twitter (n = 66) and Facebook (n = 34) from March 2020 to April 2021 during the early phase of the pandemic. The social media postings, mostly written in Malay, were analyzed for stigma-markers. The results showed that COVID-19 stigma words were mostly related to health (57%), ethnicity (29%), social class (13%), and work (1%). The frequencies of the types of stigma-marker in Facebook comments and tweets are similar. COVID-19 patients were referred to as stupid, irresponsible, and criminals. Racist remarks were also evident in the social media messages. The findings indicate that people who are already victims of the disease are victimized further due to the stigmatization by strangers and people in their social and work circles.
