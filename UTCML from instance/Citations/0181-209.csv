Through statistical analysis of the last 3200 tweets of the top 20 celebrity Twitter accounts in terms of followers as of June 2014, the article examines sustainability of celebrity performance on the site and levels of interaction. It shows how using constructs of the celebrity interview enables celebrities to articulate what it means to be an individual and a consumer within capitalist democracies. A discourse analysis of pertinent examples from leading Twitter celebrities demonstrates how these interactions are influenced by both thematic and linguistic patterns developed in celebrity interviews and how they now also occupy the space long held by the interview as a promotional performance. This article also examines how celebrities encourage their followers to participate in this performance through the reward of direct interaction and how this is then used to extend promotion and build celebrity brands.

182,journalArticle,2017.0,"Giles, David C.",How do fan and celebrity identities become established on Twitter? A study of ‘social media natives’ and their followers.,Celebrity Studies,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=124311707&site=ehost-live,"This study explores the changing relationship in the digital era between celebrities and fans by examining a group of emerging celebrities and their followers on Twitter. Seven crime authors were chosen as a case sample, each of which published their first work after 2010 and might therefore be regarded as ‘social media natives’. The authors’ followers were categorised according to their self-descriptions into various professional and non-professional groups (e.g. ‘publishing industry professionals’, ‘fellow crime authors’). In some of these groups, notably ‘aspiring authors’ and ‘book fans/bloggers’, the performance of fandom was not always found to be uni-directional. Microanalysis of authors’ interactions with followers suggested that traditional media audience categories such as ‘fan’ have become looser in social media where all users are ‘followers’ and perform multiple identities. In particular, book bloggers seem to have carved out an important role as legitimising agents within the crime fiction field.

This wavering response to celebrity – a double-facing mode of celebrity performance in which the celebrity is disinclined to perform, yet performs nevertheless – reveals the privilege that constitutes such positioning. After all, to occupy a position of reluctance or hesitance is to have the privilege to be reluctant. Approaching celebrity as a space of fluid negotiations, we examine celebrities' first tweets on, and commentaries about, Twitter, as a means by which to demonstrate how celebrities negotiate their degree of reluctance to engage with the fields of power at play in social media interactions. In the second half of the paper, we argue that such positioning needs to be read alongside its celebrity social media 'other': the enthusiastic, entrepreneurial adoption of social media, best exemplified by the Kardashian family and their manifold social media endeavours. In their self-characterisation as social-media-made celebrities and external characterisations of them as the de facto media sell-outs, the Kardashians, as unreluctant celebrities, become the exceptions that prove the rule, inversely defining the privileged, reluctant expressions of more 'accepted' stars.

The convergence, connection and the potential for interactive address between star and audience that the online platform creates appears to position the concept of stardom in the twenty-first century as something new. This article argues that while Twitter may represent a deviation from older models of stardom, there remain important continuities and contexts between ‘old’ and ‘new’ celebrity behaviours and media forms. It argues that Twitter exposes, rather than creates, the multiple ways in which stardom and celebrity status can exist and be analysed, and that many online practices characterised as new have clear antecedents in wider histories of stardom. It suggests that much of the value of exploring celebrity Twitter accounts lies in how the site, its usage and its content, renders historical negotiations around the construction and presentation of stardom visible. In order to do this, it draws upon a range of examples –with a particular focus on the Twitter account of John Cusack – examining how the management of online behaviour and identity illustrates significant debates around the subject of authenticity within celebrity culture.

Somerhalder’s youth engagement, in particular via Twitter, is explored. The paper considers the balance of marketing-led versus values-led communication strategies therein (which can be understood to promote smaller behaviour changes versus broader vision changes respectively) (Bortree 2012), and the potential influence of Somerhalder on mobilising participatory environmental action, politics and consciousness amongst his youthful fan demographic.

In the convergent TV era, reality producers increasingly require that stars post-personal content on social media, blogs, and online video sites. Rather than hire transmedia content creators, television networks incentivise stars to generate their own digital texts by placing them in competition with their co-stars for attention, status, and salary. This new industry strategy seeks to cut costs while extending viewer engagement. In the reality TV emotion economy, where the most effective path to fame involves dramatic self-disclosure, stars are representing the hyperbolic performance of misery, jealousy, and resentment online. Just as reality producers rely on participants’ performance of the ‘money shot’ - a televised moment of emotional upheaval - the convergent TV industry requires a ‘digital money shot’ - an online performance of dramatic emotions that drives transmedia engagement. To begin mapping the contours of the ‘digital money shot’, this article examines the multi-platform world of Bravo’s reality docu-soap franchise, The Real Housewives, and the prevalence of the Twitter war, a social media feud used to draw viewers to new media sites. This practice illustrates how performative emotions and self-disclosure form the basis of Bravo’s transmedia strategy for The Real Housewives franchise.

The hashtag was first used on the social media platform Twitter to call attention to the injustice of the situation. Many celebrities have taken up the hashtag and used their own social media accounts to draw attention to the movement. This is different from past forms of celebrity activism in that it seeks to change power structures within society. William Howell and Trevor Parry-Giles have demonstrated how celebrity activists have the power to destabilise police authority. Their power as celebrities translates to a perceived authority of their own with an ability to reach large audiences. In this article, we use qualitative textual analysis to identify dominant themes in black celebrity tweets about #BLM and racial justice issues. We analyse how black celebrities use Twitter to promote #BLM and what impact they have in promoting and defining the #BlackLivesMatter movement.

Regarded as a PR coup, particularly in the context of the ongoing Indian parliamentary elections, the 'freewheeling' interview underlined Bollywood's increasing proximity with the Modi-led BJP government. Employing a detailed analysis of the interview and the subsequent controversy, I examine the Bollywood star's role in disseminating political rhetoric, underlining in the process both shifts in discourses of Hindi film stardom, as well as the increasing politicisation of the new media ecology. In doing so, I also highlight the long-standing relationship and presence of Hindi film stars in the political arena, a fact that has received scant scholarly attention. As social networking sites like Twitter are inundated with selfies of Bollywood stars with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and hashtags like #CelebritieswithNamo and #ModiWithAkshay, it is imperative to analyse this emergent confluence of the political and the popular. Thus, using the Akshay Kumar–Narendra Modi interview as a case study, I examine not only the relationship between Hindi film stars and politics but also, the role of social media in shaping the current dynamics.

Using insights from imagology, we argue, firstly, that Wilders' use of national images allows him to align himself with the traditional narrative of Dutch collective resistance to foreign rule and thus to authenticate his political attitude as compliant with that of the Dutch national character. Secondly, turning to the field of celebrity studies, we demonstrate that this self-stylisation also involves a form of emotional work. In speeches, texts, campaign advertisements, and tweets, Wilders projects an affectively charged public self that 'moves' the audience and lends a sense of urgency to his politics as well as a feeling of authenticity to his political persona.

Exploring how he is negotiating the realities of ageing, the impact this has on the roles available to him, and his ability to endure the physical requirements of these roles has been the subject of much academic interest, with many concluding that the star is increasingly redundant. This chapter will offer an economic reading of the star and an examination of the ways in which the veteran actor has sought to, and in many cases, succeeded in, extending his celebrity status in a contemporary global media marketplace. By considering two aspects that are central to Stallone's contemporary stardom, his harnessing of social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to publicise new projects and to capitalise on earlier screen successes, and the his recent economic success in the Chinese film market, the chapter will explore how ideas of redundancy may have been applied to the star prematurely.

Despite recent changes in the Indian mediascape, the Bollywood stars' centrality remains undiminished. With the increasing synergy between film, television and digital media, the Hindi film star now straddles multiple platforms, effortlessly essaying the varied roles of a movie idol, a television personality, a social media participant and a transmedia celebrity. However, as the stars engage with social media, often conflating their 'reel' and 'real' personas, discourses of both stardom and fandom become complicated. No longer regarded as simply objects of adulation and veneration, stars are now often chastised and publicly ridiculed for their actions on social media. This shift in the star-fan dynamics becomes even more problematic in the case of the female star, who is often body-shamed and trolled on social media platforms. This paper examines the changing notions of contemporary Bollywood stardom, particularly with respect to female stars' engagement with social media and their subsequent desecration. As the female star attempts to navigate her resignification as a transmedia celebrity, her public humiliation reveals the problematic underpinnings and fissures of contemporary Bollywood stardom.

Findings indicate that the mass killers received approximately $75 million in media coverage value, and that for extended periods following their attacks they received more coverage than professional athletes and only slightly less than television and film stars. In addition, during their attack months, some mass killers received more highly valued coverage than some of the most famous American celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, and Jennifer Aniston. Finally, most mass killers received more coverage from newspapers and broadcast/cable news than the public interest they generated through online searches and Twitter seems to warrant.

What is often understood as social media via social network sites is also a form of presentation of the self and produces this new hybrid among the personal, interpersonal and the mediated - what I am calling 'presentational media'. Via Facebook, MySpace, Friendster and Twitter individuals engage in an expression of the self that, like the celebrity discourse of the self, is not entirely interpersonal in nature nor is it entirely highly mediated or representational. This middle ground of self-expression - again partially mediated and partially interpersonal (and theoretically drawing from Erving Goffman's work) - has produced an expansion of the intertextual zone that has been the bedrock of the celebrity industry for more than half a century and now is the very centre of the social media networks of the internet and mobile media. The article investigates this convergence of presentation of the self through a study of social network patterns of presentation of celebrities and the very overcoded similarity in the patterns of self-presentation of millions of users. It relates these forms of presentation to the longer discourse of the self that informed the production of celebrity for most of the last century.
