This study constitutes a wide-ranging investigation that explores how Twitter's platform has been used in the debate regarding whether mixed-gender friendships should be allowed in the Saudi context. Adopting the tools of critical discourse analysis, the study analyses the detailed discourses and discursive strategies pertaining to mixed-gender friendship in a hashtag thread of 8050 tweets collected in September 2020. Overall, the hashtag describes the public reaction and debate with respect to mixed-gender friendship in Saudi Arabia, simultaneously highlighting the contribution of the evoked tweeted arguments in raising awareness of mixed-gender friendship restrictions imposed under the configuration of religious, social, and political discourses. The data analyzed demonstrates that the differences in arguments concerning mixed-gender friendships within the forms of dissent and protest are in a dialogically supportive relation with dominant political, religious, and social conservative discourses.

We use placebo analyses, performing the same analysis but with tweets assumed to be unrelated to presidential approval, to assess the relationship and conclude that the relationship is less strong than it might otherwise seem. Secondly, we suggest following users longitudinally, which enables us to find evidence of a political signal around the 2016 presidential election. For the goal of supplementing traditional surveys with social media data, our results are encouraging, but cautionary.

However, how expression facilitates those values is underexplored. This Article proposes a doctrinal framework of free speech consisting of four parts: right of control over one‚Äôs information, right to know, right of access to platforms, and behavioral rules of public discussion. These are the constitutive parts that are necessary for the exercise of free speech to be meaningful and effective. After elaborating on these elements, this Article tests the framework by analyzing four cases: the European Union‚Äôs Right to Be Forgotten, the information disclosure laws of China, the blocking of Trump‚Äôs Twitter account, and the Indian hate speech incident. Those four cases offer a more comprehensive scenario as to how the quadruple framework operates in real contexts.

To do this, I analyzed tweets containing the phrase ""ang tunay na lalake"" (the real man) and the hashtag ""# angtunaynalalake"". Using qualitative content analysis, the following themes were generated: 1) Romance and Masculinities which highlights heteronormativity of romantic context and the concept of ""more deserving real man"" - a construct produced through networked masculinity and within the context of fandom and bigotry; 2) Masculine Capital - highlights how rites of passage, specifically circumcision, can be overshadowed by masculine capital to the point that failing to meet the required masculine capital would render one as 'de-circumcised'; and lastly, 3) Online Resistance to Hegemonic Masculinity - shows the use of jokes, sarcasm, and confrontation in questioning hegemonic masculinity.

Traditional machine learning models may encounter problems when used in such a context, due to the peculiarities of microblogging sites and the manner in which these networks interact (both between themselves and with other networks). Moreover, state-of-the-art approaches have focused on non-transparent techniques that cannot be audited; so, despite the fact that they are top performing techniques, it is impossible to check if the models are actually fair. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised methodology that uses our Discriminatory Expressions algorithm for feature selection to detect expressions that are biased towards extremist content (Francisco and Castro 2020). With the help of human experts, the relevant expressions are filtered and used to retrieve further extremist content in order to iteratively provide a set of relevant and accurate expressions. These discriminatory expressions have been proved to produce less complex models that are easier to comprehend, and thus improve model transparency. In the following, we present close to 70 expressions that were discovered by using this method alongside the validation test of the algorithm in several different contexts.

In this context, then, #MeToo took an understandably collective turn, translating the hashtag from an individually voiced ""Me Too"" centering on the experience of victimization to a collective ""I Too Accuse"", echoing this tradition of speak-outs. This other approach actually offers the benefits of more expansive and certainly a less blindered view of feminist activism and the #MeToo movement. The feverish mobilization around the Twitter hashtag #MeToo occurred relatively recently, in 2017, but events since then provoke a distanced vantage point from which to view the movement anew.

But to the physically disabled, knowledge is more appropriately identified with empowerment. That is a fine distinction but one that has profound implications. The former implies control over others; the latter conveys control over ones own life. Ramps, curb cuts, accessible entrances and bathrooms, public transportation, Braille signs, and crosswalks for the hearing impaired are all significant strides toward inclusion mandated by those in power. They make mobility possible for those with diverse physical disabilities. They do not necessarily empower; for that to occur a person must have knowledge of the enabling adaptation. Will there be curb cuts along my path? Will the building's entrance be accessible? Which bathrooms are accessible? Will the elevator be in service? Questions like these are addressed daily by those with disabilities who endeavor to go about their day unencumbered with the matter-of-fact attitude of the physically abled. At the University of Tennessee we are proposing a suite of integrated information systems that would provide a variety of archival resources as well as real-time information for the disabled in need of navigation assistance. This system would leverage existing technology, such as Google maps, GPS navigation, Twitter and other internet resources to develop site-specific, real-time resources that address a variety of mobility issues.

Thanks to an active community of online commentators made up primarily of academics, researchers, staff of non-governmental organizations and journalists, Twitter is a vibrant place to monitor the pulse of international criminal law generally and the International Criminal Court specifically. Twitter, thus, uniquely elevates a comparatively small commentator class and amplifies their narratives about the field of international criminal justice. Yet with an apparent lack of voices from across the diverse community of practitioners, or the input of diplomats and technocrats who make the field possible, commentators may exert a disproportionate influence over public perceptions of international criminal justice. Cognisant of the stark interplay between politics and law in international criminal justice ‚Äî often including powerful forces with nefarious agendas ‚Äî and an abundance of individuals motivated by a desire to be seen and heard, this community may at times exhibit problematic behaviours (unwittingly or otherwise).

Using the social media platform Twitter, researchers collected a 58-day sample of public posts that used the hashtag Ban the Box (#BantheBox). A qualitative thematic analysis was used to assess the content of tweets to identify underlying themes related to the Ban the Box movement. Two researchers independently coded the contents of each original tweet (N=204) and reached consensus on identified themes. Results showed two underlying themes: first, risky business or the perceived risks businesses take in hiring persons with prior justice system involvement, and second, that individuals with prior justice system involvement are a vulnerable population. This study highlights how Twitter is used to communicate about social justice-related issues. Further, this paper serves as a call to action for policymakers, social workers, and researchers to consider this medium when advocating for individuals with prior justice system involvement.

It argues that because of geographical and social mobility experiences, families have not remained static, and consequently, the further they go from the village the more modernized they become. In recent times, African societies as well as family histories have been concerned with connecting with those who have been left behind. As a result, the blueprint that marks out the African family today is found in its mobility both within and out of the continent. At the same time, what glues the family together is the newer forms of technologies encapsulated in Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), which include amongst many others the cell phone, internet, WhatsApp, and Twitter. Letters pre-dated these new technologies and were significantly used by migrant families to stay ""in touch"". Families began in the village, and as newer technologies were introduced-motor cars, a postal service and motorable roads-they moved or thought about places further away. With later technological developments, such as air travel and the mobile phone, families found themselves in distant diasporic spaces. This paper therefore hopes to make a contribution that relates family history and the history of migration to technology and social change. It also has the great value of discussing an area that gets too little attention in historiography. Fundamentally, the paper attempts to compare and contrast the use of technology, the news that could be shared (welfare, births, or obituaries), the length between contacts, the ability to make visits in person, the tensions that cropped up between family members abroad and those back at home in two periods, the 1930s-1940s and the 1990s to the present. What did these periods have in common? What was different and why? For the purpose of clarity, I will start the paper with a short introduction about the area, the issues of family formation, and kfaang. The second part of the paper will focus on the discussion of the ""newness"" of those who migrated to more modern places and the role of technology. The third part compares/contrasts the connections of families in the two periods (1930s-1940s and 1990s-present) in order to flesh out the argument.",communication technology; modernity; family; Cameroon; kfaang; Kom,WOS,0,,,,,,,,0

While this categorisation does not presuppose discrimination in itself, it appears to be a precondition for discursive discrimination. COVID-19 age-related risks have particularly exacerbated ageism on social media, fuelling discourses driven by intergenerational tension. Despite the importance of social media in contemporary communication, there is still scant research on the representation of ageism in these environments. This paper attempts to fill this void by exploring millennials' use of the derogatory Twitter hashtags #BoomerDoomer and #BoomerRemover to discriminate 'baby boomers' as the COVID-19 risk group. Informed by Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) showing interest in discriminatory discourse in the media, the study aims at disclosing the main themes and discursive strategies used to construe ageist content in a sample of original tweets posted during the initial stage of the disease outbreak when the hashtags were trending. Framed by a CDA taxonomy of discriminatory discursive strategies, the combined thematic and discourse analysis highlights how the chosen topics and discursive strategies subtly perpetuate ageism, thus suggesting its resurgence in the COVID-19 era.

The nature of these firms is particularly in focus as their main marketing strategy is based on selling intangible products with a promise to effect business change. The implication is that potential clients often choose a service firm based on who they feel they can trust, suggesting that success for these corporations comes down to creating a brand that is relevant to clients, believable in its claims, and able to deliver on its promises. In particular, the study examines how the Big Four create narrative content across multiple digital media platforms and, for this purpose, a corpus of linguistic and visual data extracted from company websites and Twitter accounts is analysed by employing the theory of social semiotics and using multimodal critical discourse analysis. The data ensembles are examined with a special emphasis on how storytelling strategies are embedded in texts and images, and strategically constructed to legitimise specific social practices realised in discursive representations of each firm's identity.

The aim of this paper is to develop a systemic risk model which, differently from existing ones, employs not only the information contained in financial market prices, but also big data coming from financial tweets. From a methodological viewpoint, we propose a new framework, based on categorical graphical models, that can estimate systemic risks with models based on two different sources: financial markets and financial tweets, and suggest a way to combine them, using a Bayesian approach. From an applied viewpoint, we present the first systemic risk model based on big data, and show that such a model can shed further light on the interrelationships between financial institutions. This can help predicting the level of returns of a bank, conditionally on the others, for example when a shock occurs in another bank.

Individuals on the internet began seeking information from other creators and creating their own content. These online communities allowed individuals to communicate across the globe, gravitating toward people like them or those who shared similar beliefs. Conversations around vaccinations have been particularly polarizing across social media even though scientific literature continually validates their safety and effectiveness. This study will explore whether online public discourse about vaccinations changes before and after major scientific publications, and will measure what is related to social engagement around vaccinations on Twitter. In September 2018, two weeks‚Äô worth of Twitter posts (n = 2,919) discussing vaccinations were collected, coded, and analyzed before and after two major 2014 scientific publications. Linear regression analyses examined variables related to engagement with vaccination-related Tweets pre- and postpublication. Antivaccine-related Tweets decreased by over 25% after scientific publications, while provaccine Tweets increased by 16.6%. Regression models suggest verification status and number of followers were the strongest predictors of Twitter engagement. Findings indicate that scientific publications might affect what people public health information people share online, and how people engage with online content. In a time when false information is easily spread online, this study suggests the need for continual scientific publication on ‚Äúhot topics,‚Äù and urges researchers to partner with influential individuals on social media to disseminate effective, evidence-based, and user-friendly public health information to the public.",,SAGE,0,,,,,,,,0

This paper offers a theoretical and empirical exploration of a less-frequently discussed form of solidarity between two diverse campaigns; one based less on shared identity and more on shared values; one that is aimed less at persistence and more at short-term impact. Building upon earlier conceptual work (Wright et al. 2018), we call this form drive-by solidarity because of its one-way, unsolicited, hit-and-run nature. This paper examines drive-by solidarity through case of Anonymous' ""Operation KKK"" (#OpKKK), an online hacktivist campaign against the Ku Klux Klan carried out in response to threats of violence they made against #BlackLivesMatter protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in November 2014. After constructing a timeline of events from available news stories and videos for context, we use over three million tweets to conduct a series of network analyses to model the most significant online accounts associated with each campaign as well as the connections built across the respective online discursive spheres through retweets and mentions. We graph both the period of the 2014 #OpKKK campaign, along with its revival one year later, in order to empirically examine the short- and long-term effects. Although Anonymous acted unilaterally and made no efforts to be inclusive of #BlackLivesMatter activists in their deliberations, the campaigns became politically coordinated. #OpKKK successfully achieved its initial goals; however, longer-term effects were more volatile. This form of solidarity is theoretically compelling because it seems to challenge much extant theory on the role of identity in building solidarities, and even forces us to rethink social movement success. Furthermore, we propose that drive-by solidarity could offer a possible model for other movements seeking high-impact, low cost, short-term campaigns.

Such is the power of images of the child they can and have shaped the history of nation states, shifted policy and become emblematic of a cry for change. In journalism, filmmaking, and news media the child can become the symbol of a nation, a conflict, a tragedy and the failure of policy, or indeed the adult world, to care and protect childhood itself. Using evocative images from across the 20th and 21st century, this paper interrogates how idealised notions of childhood become focal and challenged by images which reveal the death, deprivation and destruction of children. The image of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi's body on a Turkish Beach in 2015 resonated around the world. It became the biggest trending photo on Twitter within 24 h and graced the front of hundreds of global newspapers the following day. It also demanded a political response, as presidents and prime ministers scrambled to hold press conferences and generate policy to respond to the Syrian and wider so-called Mediterranean crisis. This is just a recent example in a long line of iconic images of 'the child' that have shaped policy and shifted hearts and minds. The power and influence of these photographs is traced here to highlight where the discursive vulnerability of a single child becomes emblematic of the failures of the powerful: adults, governments, nation states, and global governance. Using the examples of famine stricken South Sudan (1993) and the 'migrant crisis' of the Mediterranean Sea (2015), how these hitherto anonymous children briefly become everybody's child is explored here.",media; images; photographs; childhood; social construction,WOS,0,,,,,,,,0

To do so, we conduct a rigorous qualitative analysis of discourse during a two-week period in which the Florida legislature considered and passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act after a shooter killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. We systematically explore how two framing dynamics ‚Äì competition and amplification ‚Äì shape what frames political actors champion and the relative effects of these dynamics on individual claimsmaking in 438 letters to the editor and op-eds appearing in mainstream outlets, 4,962 emails sent to Florida Governor Rick Scott, and 1,000 tweets. We find that amplification and competition shape the relative visibility of frames and the frequency with which individuals use these frames in their claimsmaking. Generally speaking, gun control and progressive groups selectively amplified frames associated with the emerging, student-led Never Again Marjory Stoneman Douglas movement and legislative frames that were consistent with their goals. This seems to have increased the visibility of these ideas in mainstream outlets and influenced claimsmaking insofar as individuals drew on amplified frames across the forums relatively frequently. This was not true of frames opposing gun control. Gun rights groups bickered with politicians and among themselves. As a result, gun rights frames were less prevalent in mainstream discourse and in individual claimsmaking.

A corpus of 701 tweets (published between 4 July 2021 and 10 April 2022) from Le Pen‚Äôs official Twitter account were analysed through a critical discursive psychological approach. Through our analyses, we identified five subject positions that Le Pen constructed for herself in her discourse: the Protector, the Punisher, the Women‚Äôs Candidate, the Mother, and the Voice of Justice. Our findings show that through careful discursive negotiation between femininity and masculinity, Le Pen managed to engage in a dynamic positioning between a harsh candidate who punishes ‚Äúthe Other‚Äù and a compassionate and loving mother candidate who takes care of the nation‚Äôs children. This flexible way in which Marine Le Pen claimed different positions for herself may have been a central factor that enabled her to appeal to millions of voters in the 2022 French presidential elections. The study contributes to the literature on identity politics and the discursive mobilisation of gender by female far right political leaders.",,SAGE,0,,,,,,,,0

Ubiquitous visual technologies, the possibility to distribute and use images from heterogeneous sources across different social contexts and publics, and increasingly powerful facial recognition tools afford new avenues for law enforcement. Concurrently, these changes also trigger fundamental concerns about privacy violations and all-encompassing surveillance. Using the example of police investigations after the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, the present article provides insights into how different actors in the political and public realm in Germany deal with these potentials and tensions in handling visual data. Based on a qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles (n=42), tweets (n=267), experts‚Äô reports (n=3), and minutes of parliamentary debates and committee hearings (n=8), this study examines how visual data were collected, analyzed, and published and how different actors legitimated and contested these practices. The findings show that combined state, corporate, and privately produced visual data and the use of facial recognition tools allowed the police to cover and track public life in large parts of the inner city of Hamburg during the summit days. Police authorities characterized visual data and algorithmic tools as objective, trustworthy, and indispensable evidence-providing tools but black-boxed the heterogeneity of sources, the analytical steps, and their potential implications. Critics, in turn, expressed concerns about infringements of civic rights, the trustworthiness of police authorities, and the extensive police surveillance capacities. Based on these findings, this article discusses three topics that remained blind spots in the debates but merit further attention in discussions on norms for visual data management and for governing visibility: (1) collective responsibilities in visibility management, (2) trust in visual data and facial recognition technologies, and (3) social consequences of encompassing visual data collection and registered faceprints.

The article raises the question about how researchers' subjective decisions affect the performance of supervised deep learning models. The aim is to deliver practical advice for researchers concerning: (1) whether it is more efficient to monitor coders' work to ensure a high quality training dataset or have every document coded once and obtain a larger dataset instead; (2) whether lemmatisation improves model performance; (3) if it is better to apply passive learning or active learning approaches; and (4) if the answers are dependent on the models' classification tasks. The models were trained to detect if a tweet is about current affairs or political issues, the tweet's subject matter and the tweet author's stance on this. The study uses a sample of 200,000 manually coded tweets published by Polish political opinion leaders in 2019. The consequences of decisions under different conditions were checked by simulating 52,800 results using the fastText algorithm (DV: F1-score). Linear regression analysis suggests that the researchers' choices not only strongly affect model performance but may also lead, in the worst-case scenario, to a waste of funds.

Soon after, right-wing oppositional tweets were posted (n = 288) contesting the arguments of Turei and her supporters, and left-wing responses to those arguments (n = 214). Drawing on Mouffe's dissensual model, this article undertakes a close, qualitative analysis of those 502 tweets, in order to move towards a method for empirically distinguishing between antagonistic and agonistic tweets, identifying the latter as putting forward arguments which can be identified by the researcher and potentially engaged with by ideologically opposed adversaries. The results show a majority of the tweets were agonistic, with implications for the future study of social media policy debates and for the online practices of scholars.

I focus on the analysis of three elements present among the contents shared by this preacher on his Twitter account: Hashtags, visuals and links.

Das leadership beider Bewegungen ist mit jeweils einem Dutzend Personen relativ klein. Zur Erforschung des leadership von sozialen Bewegungen bieten sich insbesondere Methoden der Biographieforschung an. In ethnologischen Forschungsarbeiten wird die Biographieforschung meist mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden wie der Teilnehmenden Beobachtung kombiniert. Zentral f√ºr die Ethnologie sind weiterhin ein Perspektivwechsel und die lange Feldforschung. Dabei erheben Ethnolog*innen sehr unterschiedliche biographische Daten und verkn√ºpfen diese miteinander. F√ºr den vorliegenden Artikel erhoben Jan Budniok und Andrea mit den Biographien der Mitglieder des leadership auch ihre Familiengeschichten, um mehr √ºber Darstellung historisch gewachsener Netzwerke zu erfahren. Zudem h√§ngen die individuellen Beweggr√ºnde aktiv zu werden in den hier untersuchten F√§llen oft mit der eigenen Familiengeschichte zusammen oder werden in einem solchen Zusammenhang dargestellt, um das eigene Handeln zu legitimieren. Diese Kombination von Biographieforschung mit weiteren ethnographischen Methoden ist eine St√§rke des ethnographischen Ansatzes und kann auch von anderen Disziplinen in der Erforschung sozialer Bewegungen fruchtbar gemacht werden. In 2014, due to an economic crisis, several new protest groups evolved in Ghana. The most prominent amongst them were Occupy Ghana and the Citizen Ghana Movement. Comprising of just a dozen people, the leadership groups of both these movements were relatively small. One of the best methods of researching the leadership of social movements is biographical research. Anthropologists usually combine biographical research with other ethnographic methods, most prominently participant observation. Crucial in anthropological research is a change in the research perspective as well as the long duration of field research. Anthropologists thus collect very different types of biographical data that they then connect to each other. Thus, for the article Jan Budniok and Andrea Noll collect not only the biographies of the interview partners themselves but also their family histories in order to learn more about how historically developed networks are represented. What is more, the reasons for becoming active in a leadership role are often linked to the individual's family history. Or rather, activists make use of their family histories to legitimize their activism. This combination of biographical research with other ethnographic methods is one of the strengths of the ethnographic approach, and one which other disciplines researching social movements may well take advantage of.

Against this backdrop, we ask how transnational COVID-19 related online discourse has been throughout the EU over the first year of the pandemic. Which events triggered higher transnational coherence or national structuration of this specific issue public on Twitter? In order to study these questions, we rely on Twitter data obtained from the TBCOV database, i.e., a dataset for multilingual, geolocated COVID-19 related Twitter communication. We selected corpora for the 27 member states of the EU plus the United Kingdom. We defined three research periods representing different phases of the pandemic, namely April (1st wave), August (interim) and December 2020 (2nd wave) resulting in a set of 51,893,966 unique tweets for comparative analysis. In order to measure the level and temporal variation of transnational discursive linkages, we conducted a spatiotemporal network analysis of so-called Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). HINs allow for the integration of multiple, heterogeneous network entities (hashtags, retweets, @-mentions, URLs and named entities) to better represent the complex discursive structures reflected in social media communication. Therefrom, we obtained an aggregate measure of transnational linkages on a daily base by relating these linkages back to their geolocated authors. We find that the share of transnational discursive linkages increased over the course of the pandemic, indicating effects of adaptation and learning. However, stringent political measures of crisis management at the domestic level (such as lockdown decisions) caused stronger national structuration of COVID-19 related Twitter discourse.",MEDIA; Twitter; COVID-19; PATTERNS; discourse analysis; POWER; SITES; DISEASE; dynamic networks; European public sphere; heterogeneous information networks; transnationalization,WOS,0,,,,,,,,0

In this paper, we analyse how public digital debate in Spain gives insight into this topic. Specifically, we are interested in analysing the ways in which processes such as polarization or incivility are manifested on social networks. Our thesis is that, in addition to the central role played by structural machismo, there are particular characteristics of online debate that regulate the presence of polarization and incivility. In order to assess this, we analyse two case studies on Twitter, 'La Manada' and 'Cu√©ntalo'. We demonstrate how spontaneous digital debates favour the emergence of negative behaviours, while those that, as is the case with 'Cu√©ntalo', are organized and structured, favour more respectful, less polarized communication.

The most important infrastructural element of this information society is the internet which enables dissemination of information in a very efficient and effective way, independent from the physical proximity between two networked computers. The internet is nonhierarchical (horizontal) in the sense that it does not have an ultimate power center which determines the structure of the networks and the contents that flow within and between networks. The formation of the networks and the content of information disseminated through them are shaped by the users. Hence, the interplay between internet and individuals is bidirectional; individuals structure the networks and the structure of networks, in turn, shapes the perception of individuals regarding self, community, and time. This paper analyzes how and why people use Twitter‚Äîboth a social networking site and a micro-blogger; to what extent Twitter use reflect the constituting principles of contemporary society such as conception of time and how it may affect our notion of community and social relations. It argues that Twitter represents a replica of hypermodern society with the apprehension of time streaming embedded in its use, clustering of users around personal and professional communities and centers and the strategies that users develop in order to deal with the complexity of online hypermodernity. Twitter, and social network sites in general, are structured by the values and conceptions of the contemporary society and we need to consider them within a greater zeitgeist. The main function of these services is to reinforce and enhance the conceptions and experience of hypermodernity and to increase the rate of social change further.

Through an analysis of random lotteries on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, we find: 1) a focus on aspirational marketing to promote the lottery as a business entity through its products and 2) increased dialogue with followers (i.e. customers) compared to other public agencies. This is a shift in how public organizations traditionally use the social tools, showing there can be a balance between marketing and dialogue.

This article examines SNS as a uniquely situated manifestation of COVID-19, and draws attention to the various affordances engendered by SNS for Jewish gathering, learning, and exchange. It draws upon interviews with members of the production team, featured participants, and expert informants, as well as viewer responses from Twitter and YouTube: a dataset that includes 2000 tweets and over 1800 YouTube comments. Collectively, these data suggest that cultural arts productions such as SNS have afforded an expansive network of online Jewish conversations during COVID-19, and have invited a broad audience of Jews and non-Jews into dialogue over Jewish themes and content.

Methods: A cross‚Äêsectional survey. Participants were recruited through the interactive Chartered Society of Physiotherapy members‚Äêonly online discussion forum, the Association of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists, direct emails and snowball sampling within the authors' professional networks and Twitter. Data were collected using a structured online questionnaire and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: We received 146 responses, 95/146 (65.1%) of which were fully complete. Therapists reported targeting 367 unique outcome constructs, of which 193 (52.6%) mapped onto activities and participation (e.g. moving around using equipment, maintaining body position and walking), 158 (43.1%) on body functions (e.g. muscle strength, joint mobility and gait functions), 11 (3.0%) on body structure (e.g. muscle length) and 3 (0.8%) on environmental factors (e.g. access home environment, access school environment and family confidence).

Antifascism's interest in the built environment is often limited to the collection of address data of right-wing extremists with the aim of locating its enemies. In this piece, I write with fascism and violence through vignettes of urban situatedness. I adopt an eclectic approach, engaging with diverse theories of violence and establishing loose connections between classical sociology and fascist urbanisation, liberalism in practice and historical fascism, and material aesthetics and right-wing spaces. In so doing, I highlight endemic forms of state and capitalist violence and their spatial manifestations of ghettoisation, beautification and overcoding. Acknowledging the limits of factual knowledge and liberal appeals to the truth in breaking through fascist worldviews of domination, the architecture of the text uses a circular infrastructure that connects various parties: 'they' (Twitter users), 'I' (author), 'you' (Walter Benjamin), and numerous 'we' who are thrown together in urban environments. Rather than developing a linear argument that tries to persuade fascists, I explore writing as a collective political practice that refutes totalising accounts. With the aim of opening meaning-makings through returning to and reworking numerous views, I respond to a spiral of violence with a movement that is organised around a shared commitment to an anti-oppressive, non-hierarchical world; a movement that is out of someone's control and that spirals towards collective liberation.

With the rise in social media, scholars have become increasingly interested in how the nature of content on social media might be related to its dissemination across online social networks. In this paper, we examine how content differentiation affects the spread of a social movement. We argue that the various stages of a protest cycle moderate the relationship between the innovativeness of content related to a movement and the rate of diffusion of the movement. To test our propositions, we adopt methods from natural language processing to conduct a computational analysis of content related to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter from May 2016 to July 2016. Our findings show that tweets with less differentiated content are more likely to spread during the initial stage of a protest cycle - which we call the ripening stage - but when the movement gains momentum - entering what we call the frenzy stage - tweets with more differentiated content are more likely to spread.

To this end, the communication of IBEX35 companies in Spain with a verified corporate profile on Twitter has been studied during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the main results, it should be noted that the transfer of intangible assets has been based on a strategy where providing added value was the connecting axis of the communication actions implemented and the content provided on Twitter.

Our focus is on differences in media attention both by professional music critics and consumers, and how this is related to (a) the cities in which artists are located, and (b) the social media resources artists have at their disposal. Our analysis concerns one month of new pop album releases. The results show that artists coming from more central cities have higher chances to get media attention -- both by professional and amateur critics -- than artists from peripheral cities. Building a fan base on social media such as Facebook, Twitter or MySpace can compensate some of this inequality, but not all.

However, an unbounded network is a sprawling mass of nodes and edges. Boundary settings are typically applied, for example, a time period, a hashtag, a keyword search or a network substructure of a phenomenon of interest. Thus, the particular visualisation created is dependent upon the boundaries applied, enabling productive visual consumption, but concealing its social shaping. To explore this question of boundary setting and its associated issues, we draw on an example from the Twitter discussions about the UK Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, and the media debate surrounding the contractual hours of junior doctors during 2015‚Äì2016. We discuss the role and impact differing stakeholders have in setting these boundaries.

As the worth of scientific expertise is devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through populist political rhetoric help to produce a culture of resistance to science. Our qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts along with the news regarding anti-vaccine arguments from two selected online news sites, revealed three major themes, which we referred to as strategies used by the COVID-19 vaccine deniers in Turkey to disseminate their views. These were: an emphasis on bodily freedom and personal choice and the use of ""my body my choice"" rhetoric; the denying, devaluing, and shifting of scientific evidence; and the dismissal and/or attacking of alternative views and the deepening of the polarisation between the supporters of the COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine supporters and deniers.

Although the nonstandard form has been labeled in the literature as a calque of Spanish tener que + infinitive 'to have to', it appears in Twitter messages in all of the dialects analyzed. In fact, in our sample there are dialects in which tenir que occurs more frequently than haver de. Grammatical person of the verb used (haver or tenir) is also analyzed as a factor behind the choice of modal periphrasis. Multivariate analysis has been employed, determining that both of these factors (dialect and grammatical person) are statistically significant. The results of the multivariate analysis allow us to apply van Coetsem's (1988) theoretical framework in an attempt to describe the language contact situation in the different dialects. Source-language (sl) agentivity appears to be at work in the dialects where the nonstandard variant is prevalent, while recipient-language (rl) agentivity could be behind the use of the standard variant in the other dialects.

For many people, SM is reshaping their social world, rewriting the rules of social engagement and sociability. The use of SM has grown drastically in the past decade. Referring to the data released by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), more than half of the population are internet users and more than 90 percent of the internet users visit social networking platforms as their online activities. Referring to the same data, most of the internet users are between the age of 20s to 40s. Despite the drastic changes in SM uses, many ethical and social issues arise. The critical issues that occur in the existence of SM among others are the spread of fake news, online harassment, privacy issues, and cyberbullies. Therefore, this research aims to gain some insights into the ethical and social issues in SM among university students in Malaysia. Ethnography will be the qualitative approach for the study whereby this approach is the best approach to study people in their own environment through the use of methods such as participant observation and face-to-face interviewing. The research will apply purposive sampling as an approach to seek subjects who have some specific knowledge or expertise relevant to the topic. In other words, they are rich in the information needed for this study. Online interviews will be conducted as a method for data collection from twenty-eight (28) students from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The data will be analysed using thematic analysis whereby Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel (since most higher education institutions (HEIs) have Microsoft licenses for both faculty and students to use the Microsoft Office 365 suite) will be used as a tool to code and organise the key point and themes. The thematic analysis is a data analysis process in which themes and relationships are established by identifying statements or phrases of the data. This research involved six phases, from; i) familiarization the data set from both respondents and moderators, and ii) generating systematic codes, by identifying the relevant data within the data set, and iii) tagging the data with specific phrases or words. Next, iv) process the pattern formation, and v) identification of the first version of theme development. Theme development involves examining codes and combining, clustering, or collapsing the codes together into bigger or more meaningful patterns. Finally, vi) generate and review the top five key points per theme in addition to the key points related to the research. The approach integrates a widely used application software suite for organizing, coding, and classifying data. The features that Microsoft Excel offers as a tool to organize the key points or themes, crucially do not require advanced knowledge of the software. This research will emphasize the importance of the data analysis step in increasing the validity and reliability of findings and outline a method of analysis that is accessible to the researchers.

Before the digital revolution, the relationship between the politician and the voter was intermediated by journalists and broadcast media. In contrast to traditional media, social media are presumed to enable politicians to engage directly with the electorate (Kruikemeier, Van Noort, Vliegenthart & De Vreese, 2015). In the last decade, there was a growing interest in the role of social media in election campaigns, triggered by Barack Obama's electoral presidential election victory in 2008 and more recently by Donald Trumps' triumph in 2016 (Rodriguez-Andres, 2018). The research presented in this article answers three main questions. First, who are the politicians using Twitter for campaigning purposes and what variables can predict Twitter use? Second, when do Belgian politicians use it and with which frequency? And third: do tweeting politicians perform better at the ballot box? The main findings reveal that a Flemish candidate has a higher probability of 18,7% to be present on Twitter compared to a candidate from the French community. Another important finding is that there is no significant association between the number of tweets and number of preferential votes, although a trend towards significance was observed for Flemish politicians.

Uganda has levied the world's first tax on social media users, imposing in 2018 a daily tax on the use of fiftyeight websites and applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Skype. To access these platforms, one must pay a daily fee of 200 Ugandan Shillings ($.054 USD). This Note will use the Ugandan social media tax as a case study through which to examine the legality, under international law, of financial burdens designed to suppress political dissent. While the analysis will focus solely on Uganda's law, much of it will apply beyond Uganda's borders to countries pursuing similar legislation. Part I provides important background with respect to the Ugandan scheme. Part II explores freedom of expression over the Internet under international law and determines what types of restrictions on expression are legally permissible. Part III analyzes whether a tax that affects speech would be considered a restriction of expression. Finally, Part IV examines the social media tax through the lens of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and analyzes the consequences of a determination that the social media tax violates international norms, both within Uganda and more broadly across East Africa.

These results have real-world and theoretical ramifications for policymakers and entrepreneurial education, such as using widely used yet cutting-edge communication and Internet tools to inspire young people to start their own businesses. In this analysis, we test the hypothesis that there is a connection between the time spent on social networking sites (SNS) and measures of confidence in, and desire for, starting one's own business. Over two hundred and fifty female students from Private Universities in Bangladesh participated in online questionnaires and correlation tests. More time spent on social networking sites is correlated with more serious business thinking and behavior. Students of all sexes and all ages use Facebook, but younger students and women in particular associate the platform with entrepreneurial aspirations and attitudes more strongly than their male counterparts. There is a greater understanding of the relationship between social media presence and entrepreneurship factors because to this research. The researchers sorted the interviewees' responses into four groups based on their findings: how often they used SNS, how much they felt supported by SNS, how secure they felt in their entrepreneurial conduct, and how ambitious they wanted to be as business owners' Important motifs were also determined for each class. Institutions of higher learning may and should use social media to promote and educate aspiring business owners.

We collected three months of social media data to investigate variation in the temporal structure of sociability across American cities. We find that cities cluster into three distinct types ('Coastal', 'Transitional' and 'Heartland') and that geographic proximity together with race, education and language associate with this clustering. Specifically, we found that clusters of Blacker cities tend to tweet more per capita, but also that more highly educated cities tend to tweet less per capita.

The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of financial event announcements via social media, specifically Twitter, on share returns of stocks on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. Our research questions were tested on a sample of 833 event observations retrieved from official Twitter accounts for two years (1 January 2014 - 16 February 2016). The test was concerned with tracking stock return behavior on the event day (day 0), the pre-event window and the post-event window using the event-study methodology. This study found that there is a significant relationship between share prices and the events announced via Twitter, the type of tweets, news categories and tweeting intensity of the company involved.

Accused of transphobia, he was denounced by a prominent atheist organization, which led to intense arguments in Anglophone atheist spaces on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, lasting throughout the year. This article uses the controversy, an instance ""YouTube drama,"" as an opportunity to investigate the ways in which an imagined ""atheist community"" is constructed through internal atheist conflict. Through critical discourse analysis of 157 YouTube videos, published between the end of March and the end of November, it identifies six different discursive formations, which affected the development of the drama and offer competing conceptions of the community. By utilizing Michael Warner's theory of 'publics' and tounterpublics,' spaces that exists only for the circulation of discourse, this study approaches the drama not as an interpersonal conflict, but as a battle over the norms of discourse within the atheist community. It suggests that a public lens is useful for understanding contemporary atheism, and that the nature of publics and counterpublics helps explain the dynamics of atheist disagreement on social issues.",YouTube; drama; RELIGION; atheism; publics; transphobia,WOS,0,,,,,,,,0

In this article, we turn our attention to the production of addiction on the microblogging social media platform, Twitter, as an important emerging site in which the addicting of contemporary societies is also occurring. Our analysis explores two questions. First, we investigate the ways in which addiction is enacted via Twitter. How is addiction being made on Twitter? Second, we ask how the technology of Twitter itself is shaping meaning: how do the technological ‚Äúaffordances‚Äù of Twitter help constitute the kinds of addiction being materialized? While we find a multiplicity of meanings in the 140-character messages, we also find a pattern: a tendency toward extremes‚Äîaddiction riven between pain and pleasure. In addition, we find significant areas of commonality between approaches and notable silences around alternatives to common understandings of addiction. We argue that the constraints on communication imposed by Twitter technology afford a ‚Äúshorthand‚Äù of addiction that is both revealing and productive. Illuminated is the importance of addiction as a piece of cultural shorthand that draws on and simultaneously reproduces simplistic, reductive addiction objects. In concluding, we consider what these realities of addiction being enacted through Twitter can tell us about contemporary conditions of possibility for drug use in society and for individual subjectivities and experiences.

The advent of social media has resulted in this information spreading quicker then ever before, and in qualitatively different ways, since people no longer need to be in face-to-face contact or even know each other to pass on information in an crisis situation. Social media also provides a wealth of data about this information diffusion since much of the communication happening within this platform is publicly viewable. This data trove provides researchers with unique information that can be examined and modeled in order to understand urgent diffusion. A robust model of urgent diffusion on social media would be useful to any stakeholders who are interested in responding to a crisis situation. In this paper, we present two models, grounded in social theory, that provide insight into urgent diffusion dynamics on social networks using agent-based modeling. We then explore data collected from Twitter during four major urgent diffusion events including: (1) the capture of Osama Bin Laden, (2) Hurricane Irene, (3) Hurricane Sandy, and (4) Election Night 2012. We illustrate the diffusion of information during these events using network visualization techniques, showing that there appear to be differences. After that, we fit the agent-based models to the observed empirical data. The results show that the models fit qualitatively similarly, but the diffusion patterns of these events are indeed quite different from each other.

The protest attracted hundreds of participants who produced thousands of tweets directed at Moore's Twitter account, grouped under the label #MooreandMe. The protest, guided by Doyle's updates at her blog, garnered widespread media publicity and support from other social justice and feminist activists, raised thousands of dollars for rape survivor nonprofits, and prompted Moore to publicly state on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC news program on December 21 that all rape allegations should be taken seriously, no matter the timing or the person under scrutiny. In this paper I explain why this digital protest was successful and suggest that this campaign exemplifies the unique visibility of the negotiation of goals, tactics, and measures of success in digital protests, as well as highlights aspects of social protest that have previously gone underemphasized. The detailed public record, down to the most minor of interactions, of how the #MooreandMe protest was carried out is a boon to social movements scholars, but also compels them to reexamine their assumptions about the nature and efficacy of protest in a digital age.

Blockbots support the curation of a shared blocklist of accounts, where subscribers to a blockbot will not receive any notifications or messages from accounts on the blocklist. Blockbots support counterpublic communities, helping people moderate their own experiences of a site. This article provides an introduction and overview of blockbots and the issues that they raise about networked publics and platform governance, extending an intersecting literature on online harassment, platform governance, and the politics of algorithms. Such projects involve a more reflective, intentional, transparent, collaborative, and decentralized way of using algorithmic systems to respond to issues of platform governance like harassment. I argue that blockbots are not just technical solutions but social ones as well, a notable exception to common technologically determinist solutions that often push responsibility for issues like harassment to the individual user. Beyond the case of Twitter, blockbots call our attention to collective, bottom-up modes of computationally assisted moderation that can be deployed by counterpublic groups who want to participate in networked publics where hegemonic and exclusionary practices are increasingly prevalent.

The analysis shows that online networking yields a storage mechanism through which any individual contribution-e.g. a blog post, a comment, or a photo-is stored within a particular network and ready for virtual access by each member who connects to the network. When someone provides feedback, for example by commenting on a note, or by replying to a message, the interaction is finalized. These interactions are asynchronous, i.e. they allow individuals to relate in different moments, whenever they have time to. When the social environment is poor of participation opportunities and/or the pressure on time increases (for example due to the need to increase the working time), the stock of information and ties stored in the Internet can help individuals to defend their sociability.

Cluster analysis of a representative survey among the candidates in the 2011 parliamentary election in Denmark shows that the candidates can be divided into three groups with different campaign mixes: a group which mainly communicates through the traditional mass media, a group which emphasizes social media, and a group which puts low emphasis on media in their campaign. The place of social media in the campaign mix of Danish candidates can be explained by access to the mainstream media and incentives for individual candidates. Traditional media remain the most important communication channel in the Danish campaign, but primarily for candidates who are newsworthy due to their experience and incumbency status. These candidates use social media to generate coverage in the traditional mass media. Challengers and less experienced candidates are more likely to use social media to compensate for lack of attention from the mainstream media, in particular when they are involved in intra-party competition. It is concluded that social media are integrated into Danish campaign mix according to the incentive structure of the electoral system and the media logic which characterizes modern campaigns.

We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men.

In past years this has been relatively simple, with academic developers and researchers using APIs to access data and produce visualisations and analysis of social networks and issues. In recent years, API access has become increasingly restricted and regulated by corporations at the helm of social media networks. Facebook (the corporation) has restricted academic research access to Facebook (the social media platform) along with Instagram (a Facebook-owned social media platform). Instead, they have allowed access to sources where monetisation can easily occur, in particular, marketers and advertisers. This leaves academic researchers of digital social life in a difficult situation where API related research has been curtailed. In this paper we describe some rationales and methodologies for using APIs in social research. We then introduce some of the major events in academic API use that have led to the prohibitive situation researchers now find themselves in. Finally, we discuss the methodological and ethical issues this produces for researchers and, suggest some possible steps forward for API related research.

Findings indicate that the mass killers received approximately $75 million in media coverage value, and that for extended periods following their attacks they received more coverage than professional athletes and only slightly less than television and film stars. In addition, during their attack months, some mass killers received more highly valued coverage than some of the most famous American celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, and Jennifer Aniston. Finally, most mass killers received more coverage from newspapers and broadcast/cable news than the public interest they generated through online searches and Twitter seems to warrant.

In this work we define efficiency on Twitter, as the ratio between the emergent spreading process and the activity employed by the user. We characterize this property by means of a quantitative analysis of the structural and dynamical patterns emergent from human interactions, and show it to be universal across several Twitter conversations. We found that some influential users efficiently cause remarkable collective reactions by each message sent, while the majority of users must employ extremely larger efforts to reach similar effects. Next we propose a model that reproduces the retweet cascades occurring on Twitter to explain the emergent distribution of the user efficiency. The model shows that the dynamical patterns of the conversations are strongly conditioned by the topology of the underlying network. We conclude that the appearance of a small fraction of extremely efficient users results from the heterogeneity of the followers network and independently of the individual user behavior.

In this context, the social network and microblogging platform Twitter is one of the most widely used data sources. In particular, geospatial analyses of Twitter data are proving to be fruitful for examining regional differences in user behavior and attitudes. However, ready-to-use spatial information in the form of GPS coordinates is only available for a tiny fraction of Twitter data, limiting research potential and making it difficult to link with data from other sources (e.g., official statistics and survey data) for regional analyses. We address this problem by using the free text locations provided by Twitter users in their profiles to determine the corresponding real-world locations. Since users can enter any text as a profile location, automated identification of geographic locations based on this information is highly complicated. With our method, we are able to assign over a quarter of the more than 866 million German tweets collected to real locations in Germany. This represents a vast improvement over the 0.18% of tweets in our corpus to which Twitter assigns geographic coordinates. Based on the geocoding results, we are not only able to determine a corresponding place for users with valid profile locations, but also the administrative level to which the place belongs. Enriching Twitter data with this information ensures that they can be directly linked to external data sources at different levels of aggregation. We show possible use cases for the fine-grained spatial data generated by our method and how it can be used to answer previously inaccessible research questions in the social sciences.

The research opportunities opened up by this socio-technological innovation are, as shown by the growing literature on the topic, huge. At the same time new challenges for social scientists arise. In this paper we will focus on two of the main challenges posed to the growth of the so-called computational social science: interdisciplinarity and ethics. While the searchability and persistence of this information make it ideal for sociological research, a quantitative approach is still challenging because of the size and complexity of the data. Collecting, storing and analyzing these data often require technical skills beyond the traditional curricula of social scientists. These projects require, in fact, collaboration with computer scientists. Nevertheless developing a common interdisciplinary project is often challenging because of the different backgrounds of the researchers. At the same time the availability of this content poses a challenge concerning privacy and research ethics. Due to the amount of data and the fact that the real identity of the author is often hidden behind a nickname, it is often impossible to ask the subject involved to consent to the use of their data. On the other hand, especially in the first wave of web 2.0, this information has been ‚Äì intentionally or not ‚Äì publicly shared by the users. While a technique of dis-embedding the identity of the user from the content analyzed is often the solution used to bypass this issue, an even more important privacy-related challenge for computational social science is emerging. Due to the wide adoption of social network sites such Facebook or Google+, where a user may decide to share his content with his/her group of friends only, the amount of public data will change and decrease in the future.

Literature, because of its assumed cultural position, and its production in private, has sometimes been seen as being apart from and opposed to the cultural system of celebrity and promotion.

The 1992 protests in Los Angeles following the death of Rodney King are one example of public response to an instance of excessive use of force. More recently, the death of George Floyd led to widespread protests against excessive use of force and the current model of policing in general. The increasing popularity and availability of social media over the past decade have made it a powerful tool for mobilizing citizens and provided a place for protest. This study looks at the negative reactions of social media users to police use of force in the United States based on analysis of two significant instances: the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. Using quantitative, forensic linguistics, and advanced topic modelling methodologies, three prominent aspects of policing identified in the literature ‚Äì excessive use of force, racial bias, and legitimacy ‚Äì were analysed from 14 days of tweets following each event. Analyses deal with trends in frequency, case similarities, and topic modelling. The results show important differences in negative online reaction to the two events, particularly regarding excessive use of force: those following the Floyd death focused on the technicalities of the intervention, while those responding to the Blake death focused on its aftermath. Analysis of tweets related to racial bias and police legitimacy revealed similar patterns, with users repeating criticisms such as differential treatment according to race and the need for changes in the policing model.

However, structure observed in these records might differ from real counterparts because individuals may behave differently online and non-human accounts may even participate. To understand the difference between online and real social networks, we investigate an empirical communication network between users on Twitter, which is perhaps one of the largest social networking services. We define a network of user pairs that send reciprocal messages. Based on the correlation between degree of adjacent nodes observed in this network, we hypothesize that this network differs from conventional understandings in the sense that there is a small number of distinctive users that we call outsiders. Outsiders do not belong to any user groups but they are connected with different groups, while not being well connected with each other. We identify outsiders by maximizing the degree assortativity coefficient of the network via node removal, thereby confirming that local structural properties of outsiders identified are consistent with our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the existence of outsiders should be considered when using Twitter communication networks for social network analysis.",data analysis; online social networks; assortative mixing,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

How can sociologists systematically incorporate digital text into the sociological tool-kit? In this paper I begin by describing how sociologists have handled text data prior to the digitization of text. Next, I describe recent advancements in computational linguistics and the new computational social science. Derived from these techniques, I offer a simple network-based model for analyzing the similarities between texts and locating the emergent themes contained within text-based corpora. I illustrate these techniques in an analysis of United States' presidential inaugural speeches. The digitization of texts represents a possible sea change in how we tell socio-cultural and historical stories. I argue that the greatest potential for these techniques rests at the nexus of new computational methods and more traditional forms of text analysis.

Successful gamification practices are reliant on encouraging playful subjectivities so that users voluntarily expose their personal information, which is then used to drive behavioural change (e.g. weight loss, workplace productivity, educational advancement, consumer loyalty, etc.). The pleasures of play, the promise of a 'game', and the desire to level up and win are used to inculcate desirable skill sets and behaviours. Gamification is rooted in surveillance; providing real-time feedback about users' actions by amassing large quantities of data and then simplifying this data into modes that easily understandable, such as progress bars, graphs and charts. This article provides an introduction to gamification for surveillance scholars. I first provide brief definitions of gamification, games and play, linking the effectiveness of gamification to the quantification of everyday life. I then explain how the quantification in gamification is different from the quantification in both analog spaces and digital non-game spaces. Next, I draw from governmentality studies to show how quantification is leveraged in terms of surveillance. I employ three examples to demonstrate the social effects and impacts of gamified behaviour. These examples range from using self-surveillance to gamify everyday life, to the participatory surveillance evoked by social networking services, to the hierarchical surveillance of the gamified call-centre. Importantly, the call-centre example becomes a limit case, emphasizing the inability to gamify all spaces, especially those framed by work and not play. This leads to my conclusion, arguing that without knowing first what games and play are, we cannot accurately respond to and critique the playful surveillant technologies leveraged by gamification.

We contextualize our findings with qualitative observation of how these values are reflected in each organization's online spaces, including Facebook, Twitter, and key organizational websites, as well as private spaces such as email. We found liberty, the value most mentioned by Tea Party members, was not reflected in the movement's organizational websites and Facebook pages, where user autonomy is frequently undermined. However, the Occupy value of equality is supported in the movement's web presence. We also found a set of shared central values ‚Äì privacy and security, inclusion, and consensus ‚Äì underlying both Tea Party and Occupy's approach to organization and participation. Value tensions around privacy and inclusion emerged for both groups, as some members opted not to use these tools due to security concerns and leaders struggled to adapt their communication strategies accordingly. This study provides insight into the adoption and contestation of different technological tools within grassroots social movements, how those decisions are shaped by core values, and how conflicts over the use of digital tools can result from tension between how different stakeholders prioritize those values.

Through presented multiple similarity measures, it is evidently demonstrated that homophily does exist in music listening for both online social networks. The unexpected listening similarity in Weibo also implies that knowledge from generic social networks can be confidently transferred to domain-oriented networks for context enrichment and algorithm enhancement. Comprehensive factors that might function in the formation of homophily are further probed, and many interesting patterns are profoundly revealed. It is found that female friends are more homogeneous in music listening and that positive and energetic songs significantly pull users close.

We begin by discussing various methodological confluences between digital media, social studies of science and technology (STS) and sociology. Some authors have posited significant overlap between, on the one hand, sociological and STS concepts, and on the other hand, the ontologies of digital media. Others have emphasized the significant differences between prominent methods built into digital media and those of STS and sociology. This paper advocates a third approach, one that (a) highlights the dynamism and relative under-determinacy of digital methods, and (b) affirms that multiple methodological traditions intersect in digital devices and research. We argue that these two circumstances enable a distinctive approach to methodology in digital social research - thinking methods as 'interface methods' - and the paper contextualizes this approach in two different ways. First, we show how the proliferation of online data tools or 'digital analytics' opens up distinctive opportunities for critical and creative engagement with methods development at the intersection of sociology, STS and digital research. Second, we discuss a digital research project in which we investigated a specific 'interface method', namely co-occurrence analysis. In this digital pilot study we implemented this method in a critical and creative way to analyse and visualize 'issue dynamics' in the area of climate change on Twitter. We evaluate this project in the light of our principal objective, which was to test the possibilities for the modification of methods through experimental implementation and interfacing of various methodological traditions. To conclude, we discuss a major obstacle to the development of 'interface methods': digital media are marked by particular quantitative dynamics that seem adverse to some of the methodological commitments of sociology and STS. To address this, we argue in favour of a methodological approach in digital social research that affirms its maladjustment to the research methods that are prevalent in the medium.

In many instances, his rambling verbiage makes him impossible to understand. But even when he is relatively clear his bombast and fulminations take away any credence that can be given to his voice. This usually requires clarifications and reinterpretations by his advisors and cabinet. When Trump, exercising the formal functions of the presidency, attempts to communicate with government institutions his messages are absorbed by them to suit their interests, or he is simply ignored. The original design of American government has provided ramparts against a president like Trump and his diatribes. Also, the fact that this president has been largely unable to fill positions at the highest levels of government makes it all the more difficult for him to communicate to them. The traditional media, respecting professional standards, also resist what he tries to say. Polls show that the public is also skeptical of his voice, especially when it is relayed by Twitter. The general skepticism given to him is no doubt due to the nature of his character and behavior. But Trump is indeed heard by his hardcore base when his meaning, frequently veiled, reinforces the current cultural divide in the United States. This divide can be interpreted as the contemporary sharp schism in the American ‚Äúcivil religion‚Äù‚Äîthe sacred dimension of political and social values. It can be questioned if today's political discourse is any more vitriolic than in the American past.

Further results revealed that most research is performed in the United States, is dominated by psychologists, and is focused on the military. Our findings reflect an increased awareness of the trauma of moral injury, but future research needs to address international and interdisciplinary work across populations.

This study used classic (Glaserian) grounded theory methodology to explore the experiences and concerns of mental health professionals on social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The main concern that emerged out of research interviews with 26 mental health professionals was a loss of control over others' perceptions and the loss of ability to compartmentalize the different parts of identities associated with personal and professional selves. Participants resolved these concerns through the author-identified basic social process of ""managing digital identities.""

The shift from a top-down, provider-generated Web 1.0 towards the bottom-up user-generated Web 2.0 is a trend towards unpredictability, incalculability, inefficiency and less subject to external control; a deMcDonaldization of the Web. These conclusions stem from an analysis of Web 2.0, such as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), media sharing sites (e.g., Flickr, YouTube), open source software (e.g., Linux, Firefox), Wikipedia, blogs and the blogosphere (including Twitter) and so on. It is argued here that the mechanism that allows the trend towards deMcDonaldization is the relative lack of scarcity in digital and user-generated environment as compared to the material world that the concept was created to describe. However, this argument is tempered by the fact that much of the Internet is highly rationalized. Many of the sites that allow for unpredictable user-generated content do so precisely because of their rationalized and standardized, thus McDonaldized, underlying structure. For example, Facebook, eBay and Wikipedia pages look and behave similarly for all users. Thus the conclusion is nuanced: that rationality and irrationality can comfortably coexist online, arguably due to the relative lack of scarcity. This conclusion, born out of abundance, is not possible under the McDonaldization thesis that was centered in a material world of scarcity.

However, contributions that apply ecological visions to protest are scattered, and only seldom connect their analyses to more general media ecological frameworks. The article critically reviews and classifies the diverse strands of scholarship that adopt the ecological metaphor in their exploration of activism, and connects them with the more general literature on media and communication ecologies. Moreover, it extracts the constitutive elements of this literature that can help scholars to better address the complexity of communication within social movements, and it articulates four key lessons that a media ecology lens brings to the understanding of media and protest. Finally, the article further demonstrates the strengths of this approach through an illustration of the preliminary findings of an ongoing investigation on the 15M movement in Spain.",digital activism; social movements; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; YOUTUBE; literature review; TWITTER; Media ecologies; protest ecologies,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

Further, we examined how such mediated communication is associated with users' loneliness and, in turn, satisfaction with life. Results showed that people preferred interpersonal media for social connection and masspersonal media for entertainment and information seeking. The use of interpersonal and masspersonal media and its purpose were associated with users' psychological well-being both positively and negatively.

For just as long, some Black women have resisted their mischaracterizations. Instead they have embraced a 'fat' identity. But little research has demonstrated how Black fat women participate in sport. The purpose of this study is to show how Black fat women who run use social media to unapologetically celebrate Blackness and fatness. This research uses a case-study approach to illuminate a broader phenomenon of decolonial resistance through running. In addition to analysis of websites, blogs, and news articles devoted to Black women's running, we discuss the (social) media content of two specific runners: Mirna Valerio and Latoya Shauntay Snell. We performed a critical discourse analysis on 14 media offerings from the two runners, including websites, Twitter pages, and blogs collected over a five-month period from September 2020-January 2021. The analysis examined how they represent themselves and their communities and how they comment on issues of anti-fat bias, neoliberal capitalism, ableist sexism, and white supremacy, some of the pillars of colonialism. Whereas running is often positioned as a weight-loss-focused and white-dominated colonial project, through their very presence and use of strategic communication to amplify their experiences and build community, these runners show how being a Black fat female athlete is an act of decolonial resistance. This study offers a unique sporting example of how fat women challenge obesity discourses and cultural invisibility and how Black athletes communicate anti-racist, decolonial principles.",MEDIA; POLITICS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; HEALTH; sport; critical discourse analysis; women; NEOLIBERALISM; OBESITY; BODY-IMAGE; CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; decolonize; fatness; running; SPEAKING; WEIGHT,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

In this paper, we identify key themes of tweets posted by parents of children diagnosed with cancer and align those themes with motives inspired by the well-studied Everyday Life Information Seeking framework. We propose a new motive in addition to those associated with the framework and suggest that information can be shared for endogenous reasons as well as to meet the needs of others.

In this paper, we analyse mentions of deceased Twitter users and find that Twitter facilitates multiple types of mourning behaviours previously identified in isolation within other online spaces.

Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p =.0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02‚Äì1.09, p =.00258).

Unfortunately, a regression discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Health's use of destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19.

We found that Twitter helped rumor spreaders circulate false information within homophilous follower networks, but seldom functioned as a self-correcting marketplace of ideas.

Yet, rumor rejecters neither formed a sizable community nor exhibited a partisan structure.

Using content analysis that combines both quantitative and qualitative method-ologies, we analysed the posts (N=386) uploaded to the official Instagram accounts of the main candidates for president of the Spanish government during the electoral campaigns for the two general elections held in 2019. This enabled us to meet the main objective of the study, which was to verify whether the Instagram platform is prone to hosting political messages and discussions of a populist nature. Likewise, in order to obtain a wider perspec-tive of both campaigns on the same social network, the issues forming the subject of each candidates' agendas in the same period were studied. The main results show that Instagram, like Twitter and Facebook, enables political leaders to spread messages that in essence carry a populist narrative; to use the social network as a means of electoral propaganda; and largely to avoid discussing the proposals of their political agendas.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICAL COMMUNICATION; political leaders; FACEBOOK; populism; DISCOURSE; social networks; MEDIATIZATION; PARTIES; TWITTER; IMAGE; DISCURSIVE STRATEGY; general elections; GENERAL-ELECTION; thematic agenda,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

Starting late 2012, India experienced increased GBV-related media attention, when a young Delhi woman was fatally gang raped. Public outcry ensued through Twitter. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, can erode social boundaries and permit persons to challenge social norms and the status quo. Moreover, Twitter may provide a virtual safe space in which women in India can voice their opinions about GBV and press for social change. This article shares findings from research exploring ways in which men and women used Twitter in the aftermath of the Delhi rape case, focusing on the conversations around GBV that took place, and the opportunities that Twitter offers for more strategic engagement of individuals, especially women, to press for social change.

The central claim of this essay is that the DWSN is an experiment in power/freedom, an attempt to simultaneously trace, deploy, and overcome the historical conditions in which it finds itself: the generic constraints and affordances of social networking as they have been developed over the past decade by Facebook and Twitter, and the ideological constraints and affordances of public perceptions of the dark web, which hold that the dark web is useful for both taboo activities and freedom from state oppression. I trace the DWSN‚Äôs experiment with power/freedom through three practices: anonymous/social networking, the banning of child pornography, and the productive aspects of techno-elitism. I then use these practices to specify particular forms of power/freedom on the DWSN.

This is partly due to the tendency to minimise accusations of sexism and to reframe misogyny as 'acceptable' by constructing it as a form of humour. We decided to focus on slut-shaming, one of the most virulent forms of hate speech, which has always existed but was boosted by social media, becoming a stable low-cost ingredient of today's rape culture. We propose to consider online slut-shaming as a form of 'technology-facilitated sexual violence', where digital technologies are used to facilitate both virtual and face-to-face sexually based harms. According to feminist analysis of sexual violence, this would be a matter of power rather than sex: sex would be the weapon, not the motive. We have tested this research hypothesis by focusing on the Italian reception of the MeToo campaign, triggered by Asia Argento's denunciation. More specifically, two Different Twitter corpora produced within the same five months period were examined by means of a quantitative and a qualitative methodology.

Web presence ‚Äì in this case, websites but also the use of Web 2.0 applications ‚Äì can aim to provide information and promote participation, but can also encourage a particular view of citizenship and use certain forms of communication to advance this view.

First, I will summarize interview findings with web producers to better understand the philosophy behind web presence of the youth organization, along with a look at official website content. Second, I will provide a first look at how such organizations have adapted to Web 2.0, specifically via Facebook and Twitter. This paper contributes to an understanding of how online spaces and in particular the adaptation to Web 2.0 reflect offline views towards citizenship, a particularly important focus in an environment of increasing concern as to how to reach youth via technology.

Interoperability between major online social network services holds great potential for linking a broad range of platforms, spaces, and people together in exciting new ways. Open APIs support interoperability by providing the tools to share data used to develop popular and useful Web applications, achieve seamless integration of social media services, and give rise to mutually beneficial third-party developer ecosystems that build on top of social media platforms. Yet, while Open APIs provide new ways of sharing and participating, they also provide a means for companies like Facebook to achieve market dominance, as well as undermine privacy, data security, contextual integrity, user autonomy and freedom. This paper examines interoperability enabled by Open APIs among competing online services (Facebook, Google, YouTube, MySpace and Twitter) to identify the tenuous push and pull of competition and cooperation. The author provides a summary and analysis of Facebook's Open API releases over the last five years, to determine the underlying conditions for sharing and identify the social implications of their technical features. This paper concludes by suggesting ways that users can make more informed decisions about their sharing and perhaps change the underlying conditions of interoperability all together by developing more secure and user controllable social networks, Open APIs, and online applications.

We ask how this ‚Äòmedium-specific‚Äô technique for data collection may be rendered analytically productive for social research. We argue that, as a technique that is currently beingimportedinto social research, scraping has the capacity to re-structure research in at least two ways. Firstly, as a technique that is not native to social research, scraping risks introducing ‚Äòalien‚Äô analytic assumptions such as a pre-occupation with freshness. Secondly, to scrape is to risk importing into our inquiry categories that are prevalent in the social practices and devices enabled by online media: scraping makes availablealready formatteddata for social research. Scraped data, and online social data more generally, tend to come with analytics already built in. The pre-ordered nature of captured online data is often approached as a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô, but we propose it may be turned into a virtue, insofar as data formats that have currency in the practices under scrutiny may serve as a source of social data themselves. Scraping, we propose, makes it possible to render traffic between the object and process of social research analytically productive. It enables a form of ‚Äòlive‚Äô social research, in which the formats and life cycles of online data may lend structure to the analytic objects and findings of social research. We demonstrate this point in an exercise of online issue profiling, and more particularly, by relying on Twitter and Google to track the issues of ‚Äòausterity‚Äô and ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô over time. Here we distinguish between two forms of real-time research, those dedicated to monitoringlivecontent (which terms are current?) and those concerned with analysing thelivelinessof issues (which topics are happening?).

We find that social movement coalitions theory accurately predicts the conditions under which coalitions form and dissolve for online activists, as it does for on-the-ground activists.

Through evaluating a prototype, we investigate status updates that convey design rationale, and to what consequences, in small groups in fully distributed collaboration. We found that status updates are used for a variety of purposes and that participants' comments on their collaborators' status updates provided feedback.

The victims of this phenomenon are women for the simple fact that their aggressors do not recognize their minimum rights of freedom, respect and decisionmaking. At the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, the UN acknowledged that violence against women is an obstacle to achieving equality, development and peace and that it violates and violates human rights and fundamental freedoms. The UN defines the phenomenon as a manifestation of power relations between women and men that, as history shows us, have always been unequal. Social media, it comes in a variety of forms from the most popular like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to things like blogs, business networks and forums. Those who are active online within these social media platforms each and every month reach into billions of users. Accessibility is also becoming easier, as everyone can now connect via a mobile device. The reason behind social media, why do people share? First, many want to share the content they find, because it is entertaining or the information has value. Social media helps connect people, as well as helping to grow businesses. Another reason includes people using social media for causes and charities, sharing these because they feel strongly about a certain issue. This brings us to how social media can have an impact on the community and general society. Many of the problems in the world today have more exposure, therefore bringing increased awareness of issues. This is definitely a positive side to social media, but is there also a downside?

Indeed, populist politicians are often viewed as charismatic leaders that have fire in their belly. While in the past these parties heavily relied on anti-establishment platforms and communication rhetoric, their increasing electoral success along with the growing duties linked with government membership transform them into more established parties, rather than pure outsiders, and cast doubts on the feasibility of keeping a populist rhetoric. This paper compares right-wing and non-right-wing populism, investigating whether populist leaders change their rhetorical strategy once in office, decreasing the level of negativity and adopting a more forward-looking and inclusive style of communication, with a stronger focus on fulfilling the policy proposal made during the electoral campaign rather than blaming political rivals. For this purpose, we collected a new corpus of political speeches extracted from video messages posted on Facebook by four anti-establishment party leaders in three countries (Austria, Italy and Spain), from 2016 to 2018, i.e., immediately before and immediately after their access to power. Overall, 30 h of recorded audio from 215 videos (amounting to around 140 million visualizations) have been analyzed using topic models and well-established semantic psycholinguistic dictionaries. The results highlight slight changes in the rhetoric of populist leaders once in power, mostly for non-right-wing populists, as their language becomes less negative, less assertive and more focused on government duties.",Populism; text analysis; POPULISM; election campaign; PARTIES; SYSTEM; TWITTER; EUROPE; Facebook video; political language; RADICAL RIGHT,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

Most significantly, we argue that Twitter is a widely available mobile social networking tool that can be used to reduce information asymmetries between protesters and police. Examining the content of 30,296 tweets over a nine-day period, we find that protesters frequently used Twitter to share information, including information about protest locations, as well as the location and actions of police, which is information that was formerly monopolized by the police.

For those who comment on events in real time through social media such as Twitter, a category we call the ‚Äòviewertariat‚Äô, this event was notable for Sky News's immediate coverage of a YouGov poll that seemed discrepant. Indeed, within an hour of the end of the debate, various mainstream media published a number of polls apparently at odds with each other. Such discrepancies opened a space for lay theories to emerge about relationships between political parties, media, polling firms, and the wider public itself. Individuals were pushed to find explanations and quick to publish them in a public assembly of views. Analysis of these data illuminates not just what people think, but how they think about long-term concerns of scholars and practitioners of politics and political communication, such as credibility, trust and power, and how citizens manage expectations during events where the outcome is uncertain. Accounting for viewertariat behaviour develops recent research on mediatized politics in important ways. First, we find some viewertariat members performing a lay tutelage role, providing information and explanations about polling and elections to fellow citizens who express confusion. This indicates the continued importance of informed public discussion to some citizens. Second, we find a blurring of elite/non-elite interactions alongside persistent theories about elite conspiracies.

SMSAs (1) request large amounts of public and non-public data from organizations that maintain social media pages, (2) survey these organizations to collect additional data of interest to a researcher, and (3) return the results of a scholarly analysis back to these organizations as incentive for them to participate in social science research. SMSAs thus provide a highly efficient, cost-effective, and secure method for extracting detailed data from very large samples of organizations that use social media sites. This article describes how to design and implement SMSAs and discusses an application of this new method to study how nonprofit organizations attract public attention to their cause on Facebook. I conclude by evaluating the quality of the sample derived from this application of SMSAs and discussing the potential of this new method to study non-organizational populations on social media sites as well.

Introduction The Internet has become part of our everyday lives. Many of us use it for work, hobbies, entertainment, politics, staying in touch with friends and family, learning to know new people and other cultures, for getting all kind of information, etc. In the past 10 years, we have seen the emergence of platforms like Facebook and Myspace (social networking sites), Wordpress and Blogger (blogging) Twitter (social networking, microblogging), YouTube (video sharing), Wikipedia (wiki-based encyclopaedia), or the Pirate Bay (filesharing index site). The notions of 'web 2.0' and 'social media' have been used by some scholars to describe features of such sites such as community-building and maintenance, continuous communication, user-generated content production and diffusion, collaborative authoring, and distributed content classifications (the latter mechanism is also called folksonomy). Most web 2.0 platforms collect, store, and share a lot of personal user data and data about usage behaviour. Therefore, questions about privacy violations and online surveillance have arisen in public discussions, especially concerning Google (for example the discussions about Google targeted advertising, Google Street View, Google Buzz, etc.) and Facebook (for example the discussions concerning Facebook targeted advertising, Facebook beacon, the Facebook privacy policy, Facebook places, etc.). The field of web 2.0 surveillance studies critically asks questions about the data protection aspects and power dimensions of the contemporary Internet. It is crucial for students and scholars, who are interested in the contemporary media landscape, and who study in fields such as media/communication studies, cultural studies, political science, law, computer science, social informatics, information science, sociology, business studies, advertising, marketing and public relations, philosophy, ethics, science and technology studies etc., to also engage with web 2.0 surveillance studies. Recommended readings Fuchs, Christian. 2010. 'Labour in Informational Capitalism and on the Internet'. The Information Society 26(3): 179-96. doi: Christian Fuchs discusses in this article the political economy of the contemporary Internet. He does so by giving first an introduction to Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism that is then applied for understanding aspects of the exploitation of the users of contemporary commercial Internet platforms like Facebook. Fuchs uses Dallas Smythe's notion of the audience commodity for critically discussing the business models of web 2.0. He coins the notion of Internet prosumer labour in this context. He concludes that on commercial web 2.0 platforms, user activity tends to become exploited and is unpaid labour. Surveillance is situated in the framework of this analysis. Andrejevic, Mark. 2002. 'The Work of Being Watched'. Critical Studies in Media Communication 19(2): 230-48. doi: Mark Andrejevic argues in this article that contemporary commercial forms of interactive media make use of surveillance for exploiting consumers. He introduces in this context the notion of 'the work of being watched'. This concept is based on Sut Jhally's concept of the work of watching. Andrejevic also introduces the notion of the digital enclosure and gives very good examples for online surveillance. Albrechtslund, Anders. 2008. 'Online Social Networking as Participatory Surveillance'. First Monday 13(3). [online]. Retrieved on 1 March 2011 from: . In this article, Anders Albrechtslund introduces the notion of participatory surveillance. Other than Fuchs and Andrejevic, Albrechtslund has a rather positive concept of surveillance, he focuses on the description of potentially empowering aspects of social networking sites and other web 2.0 technologies. Albrechtslund stresses the social dimension of web 2.0, its ability for enabling communication, sharing, and community-building. Mathiesen, Thomas. 2004. Silently Silenced. Essays on the Creation of Acquiescence in Modern Society. Winchester: Waterside Press. In this short 100 page book, Thomas Mathiesen discusses mechanisms and examples of how political opposition is silently silenced, that is ideologically forestalled. The work is a masterpiece of contemporary ideology critique. Mathiesen identifies mechanisms of how silent silencing works and gives many examples. In chapter 8, it is discussed how the corporate Internet works as system of silent silencing or what Mathiesen terms the synopticon.

A fundamental belief of the white supremacist 'alt-right' movement is an anti-Semitic narrative that positions Jewish people as a 'global elite' that seeks to oppress and eliminate white populations. Central to this belief is that Jewish people actively manipulate populations of colour, Black people in particular, to overtake white populations in a process known as 'white genocide' or 'the great replacement'. Based on a digital ethnography of altright communities on Voat, Twitter and Reddit, this article demonstrates how the memeified word 'cuck', a pejorative term for 'weak' men on the US political rightwing, draws from and reproduces this white nationalist conspiracy theory through allusions to interracial cuckold pornography. While disguised as innocuous, expressions like 'cuck' provide insight into how the alt-right weaponises misogynist and racist humour in its radicalisation efforts.

Consistent with the perceived characteristics of a digitized culture in political participation, 'rhizomorphic' behaviour is observed (see Lim 2017, pp. 217-23) and further examined in this study--undertaken fifteen years later, in 2020--following the country's first ever regime change in the 2018 general elections (GE14). Referencing Deleuze and Guattari's (1987, pp. 3-25) 'schizoanalysis', this study sheds light on how Malaysian youths creatively and purposefully deterritorialize and reterritorialize their political desires. Specifically, this paper observes the political mediascape post-GE14 via a database from Malaysia's 'Twitter-verse' and a collective of civil society groups (e.g., Projek Dialog, Warga Dunia, Borneo Komrad) in order to substantiate the idea of a 'digital rhizomorph'. The digital rhizomorph is defined in this study as a body of contemporary youth politics that are more experimental and collaborative than hierarchical in character. The digital rhizomorph offers a more nuanced understanding of the original concept of the 'rhizome', often reflecting and morphing based on several key factors identified in the fieldwork.

In the second part, the authors argue that in anthropology and social philosophy the term ‚Äògift‚Äô has often been used improperly, and that gift exchange has nothing to do with goods exchange, but with mutual recognition. In the third part, they use this definition to stress the importance of gift circulation through Facebook‚Äôs ‚ÄòLike‚Äô button and the Twitter feature called ‚ÄòMention‚Äô. In conclusion, the authors deal with the ‚ÄòLike economy‚Äô, i.e. the interference between gift exchange and market economy which is daily at work online.

This paper argues that closely examining content created by others and looking at one's own content through other people's eyes, a common part of social media use, should be framed as social surveillance. While social surveillance is distinguished from traditional surveillance along three axes (power, hierarchy, and reciprocity), its effects and behavior modification is common to traditional surveillance. Drawing on ethnographic studies of United States populations, I look at social surveillance, how it is practiced, and its impact on people who engage in it. I use Foucault's concept of capillaries of power to demonstrate that social surveillance assumes the power differentials evident in everyday interactions rather than the hierarchical power relationships assumed in much of the surveillance literature. Social media involves a collapse of social contexts and social roles, complicating boundary work but facilitating social surveillance. Individuals strategically reveal, disclose and conceal personal information to create connections with others and tend social boundaries. These processes are normal parts of day-to-day life in communities that are highly connected through social media.

I tackle this issue by taking on four tasks. (1) I conceptualize what a digital document is and outline contemporary examples. I argue that the digital document is an atomization of life into the consumable. (2) I ask why we document and conclude that we do so in order to exist.

(4) Finally, I use these insights to build an argument about how experience is changed when filtered through our constant awareness of its potential documentation. I argue that to some degree the document is not simply the reflection of experience, but instead, experience is being driven and changed by its potential documentation.

We call this specific type of representative linkage 'synecdochal representation'. In it, the leader's body performs three key functions: it mirrors certain popular traits that are characterized as 'low', it displays marks of exceptionality, and it appropriates symbols of institutional power. These tasks are performed through particular ways of acting, dressing, talking, eating, and the like, in public. Social media has become a key locus for bodily self-presentation because it is used to create the appearance of intimacy and spontaneity through the distribution of 'candid' pictures and videos. This paper will analyze how the self-presentation of populist and non-populist leaders are established through Twitter, what images they choose to disseminate, and how they are re-signified by the audience. To do so, we will focus on the two Latin American politicians: Cristina Fernandez (with a populist style) and Mauricio Macri (with a technocratic one).",social media; populism; bodily self-presentation; populist leadership; populist representation,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

What is often understood as social media via social network sites is also a form of presentation of the self and produces this new hybrid among the personal, interpersonal and the mediated - what I am calling 'presentational media'. Via Facebook, MySpace, Friendster and Twitter individuals engage in an expression of the self that, like the celebrity discourse of the self, is not entirely interpersonal in nature nor is it entirely highly mediated or representational. This middle ground of self-expression - again partially mediated and partially interpersonal (and theoretically drawing from Erving Goffman's work) - has produced an expansion of the intertextual zone that has been the bedrock of the celebrity industry for more than half a century and now is the very centre of the social media networks of the internet and mobile media. The article investigates this convergence of presentation of the self through a study of social network patterns of presentation of celebrities and the very overcoded similarity in the patterns of self-presentation of millions of users. It relates these forms of presentation to the longer discourse of the self that informed the production of celebrity for most of the last century.

While an increasing number of contributions addresses the topic of transnationalism in far right politics, few systematic investigations exist on the actors and discourses favored in transnational exchanges on social media. Building on the literature on the far right, social movements, transnationalism and the Internet, the paper addresses this gap by studying the initiators and the issues that are favored in online exchanges between audiences of far right organizations, e.g. political parties and movements across France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. We use a new dataset on the activities of far right Twitter users that is analyzed through a mixed methods approach. Using social network analysis, we detect transnational links between far right organizations across countries based on retweets from audiences of far right Twitter users. Retweets are qualitatively coded for content and compared to the content retweeted within national communities. Finally, using a logistic regression, we quantify the level to which specific issues and organizations enjoy high levels of attention across borders. Subsequently, we use discourse analysis to qualitatively reconstruct the interpretative frames accompanying these patterns. We find that although social media are often ascribed much power in favoring transnational exchanges between far right organizations, there is little evidence of this. Only a few issues (anti-immigration and nativist interpretations of the economy) garner transnational far right audiences on Twitter. In addition, we find that more than movements, political parties play a prominent role in the construction of a transnational far right discourse.",SOCIAL MEDIA; Twitter; EMERGENCE; EXTREME-RIGHT; Far right; issues; movements; PATTERNS; PEGIDA; PROTEST; social network analysis; transnationalism,WOS,-,,,,,,,,0

In cities, urban green spaces are believed to provide many benefits to urban populations in terms of mental and emotional well-being.

Using a dataset obtained from Twitter as the basis for emotional explorations, sentiment analysis was performed on over 10,000 tweets to ascertain the positivity/negativity of individuals. Positive responses were more common than negative responses across all seasons, with happiness and appreciation of beauty being the common positive emotions identified. For the negative responses, fear and anger were present in similar amounts, with fewer tweets indicating sadness and disgust. Our findings show that Twitter data is a viable source of information to researchers investigating human interaction and emotional response to space in cities. Such information has implications for urban planners and park managers, enabling the creation of evidence-based spaces which enhance positive outdoor experience. Limitations in using Twitter data are discussed and these should be considered in future research.

This review presents what is currently known about the way climate change is discussed on Twitter, acknowledging advantages and limitations and suggesting future areas for study. As an accessible platform, Twitter allows public expression of opinions on climate change and provides data on how these fluctuate over different times and places. Moving forward, studies assessing climate views can be improved by better linking them to demographic and other data indicating the population that Twitter users represent. The open‚Äêended content of tweets provides additional information, such as which topics are associated with climate change and which terms are used to discuss it. Future studies can build on these results to capture a wider range of climate‚Äêrelated discussion. Finally, researchers are using Twitter to understand who initiates and participates in climate change dialog and how, by categorizing users as different actors‚Äîsuch as politicians, celebrities, NGOs, or the general public. Future research could consider how effective these efforts are, and how Twitter activity translates to offline outcomes.

The latter deems the Internet as a fragmented and individualized space, which, by definition, destroys any possibility of collective deliberation and discussion. However few scholars have systematically examined the empirical relation between politics and social media. Through a quantitative-qualitative analysis, grounded on the digital methods paradigms and based on a dataset of 181085 tweets collected during the Primarie of Centro Sinistra 2012, we would like to show how Twitter can be conceived of as a civic device that permits a specific political discourse and new forms of political association to be materialized - both entities that would remain unseen otherwise. In the end we suggest that it is possible to construct a new theory of the digital public sphere starting from the Tardian notion of public.

We fill this gap by analysing the digital discussion around the Twitter hashtag #RefugeesWelcome as a case of 'digital movement of opinion' (DMO). When the refugee crisis erupted in 2015, an extraordinary wave of empathy characterized the publics' reactions in key European hosting countries, especially as a result of viral images portraying refugee children as the main victims. Using a triangulation of network, content and metadata analysis, we find that this DMO was driven primarily by social media elites whose tweets were then echoed by masses of isolated users. We then test the post-DMO status of the hashtag-sphere after a potentially antithetical shock such as the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, which polarized the network public. Overall, we argue that the concept of DMO provides a heuristically useful tool for future research on new forms of digital citizen participation.

The increasing popularity of social media raises a number of questions regarding why we use it so much and what aspects influence this activity. What about gender? What about education, income, age or social status? This paper answers some of these questions using statistical analyses and by dividing overall social media use into selected social media, i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitter. The analysis used a dataset that contains information related to 2002 respondents from the U.S. and their social media activity. The results show that people with high household incomes and high education use social media the most. As age increases, social media use decreases, while bigger household income means that social media are used more. Overall, understanding where and at what frequency users are on social media can be a key competitive advantage.

Twitter allows subscribers to write a 140-character status update, called a ‚Äòtweet'. This research analyzes the intersection of microblogging and Canadian politics. There is little scholarship on the political aspects of Twitter. This paper seeks to fill this gap through a content analysis of the most popular Canadian political hashtag, #cdnpoli. Designated by a ‚Äòhash' symbol (#), a hashtag is a keyword assigned to information that describes a tweet and aides in searching. With 50 million tweets per day, hashtags are central to organizing information on Twitter. Hashtags organize discussion around specific topics or events. Political hashtags came to prominence in events like the 2009 Iran presidential election. Indeed, #iranelection was the number one news topic on Twitter in 2009. The popular literature suggests that Twitter is a democratic media because it allows for on-the-ground reporting of breaking news and democratic activism. This analysis shows that informing is the primary function of a political hashtag such as #cdnpoli. Political dialogue and reporting is rare. Contributors scour the internet for relevant online information on Canadian politics and use #cdnpoli as a dissemination feed. The value of a political hashtag derives from the real-time nature of the information shared.

While immigrant advocates were quick to explain the myriad constitutional problems with this proposal, elements of Trump's dream are already a reality. This Article reveals how a single Customs and Border Protection officer can short-circuit the checks and balances prescribed by U.S. and international law to protect refugees from being returned to harm, and cast a long shadow over a future, meritorious asylum claim. In light of the growing attention to the plight of those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum at our borders, this Article examines shortcomings in both law and practice, illuminating the long-lasting ramifications of erroneously issued expedited removal orders for asylum seekers and their families. Congress designed the expedited removal system to expedite deportations and circumvent due process before an immigration judge. Certain humanitarian protections are built into the system to ensure that the United States meets its international and domestic legal obligations not to return refugees to a place where they would face persecution or torture. In practice, these humanitarian protections are too often improperly implemented and front-line border enforcement officials, whether manifesting bias against asylum seekers or lacking proper training and expertise, routinely ignore U.S. law and the Department of Homeland Security's own regulations. This results in the wrongful deportation of asylum seekers and, as revealed in the Article, in permanent negative ramifications for those lucky enough to make it back over the border to in an attempt to re-apply for asylum. The Article examines the disastrous interplay between two of the ""speed deportation"" processes of expedited removal and reinstatement of removal, the lack of sufficient safeguards that leave refugee screening at our borders in the shadows, and the absence of judicial review. The Article seeks not only to expose and analyze this problem, but also to improve the situation by considering a suite of pragmatic, actionable solutions to close the gap between the humanitarian protections prescribed by law and the reality faced by asylum seekers at the U.S. border. As an immediate first step to implement the humanitarian protections enshrined in law, the Article explores the merits and risks of using readily available technology: the use of Body-Worn Cameras by Customs and Border Protection officers conducting screenings of potential refugees at the border to fill the protection gap.

Researchers have raised concerns over the use of social media data in research (for example, boyd and Crawford, 2012; Housley et al, 2014; Tinati et al, 2014), exploring the ontological and epistemological grounding of the emerging field. We contribute to this debate by drawing on Wittgensteinian philosophy to elucidate hitherto neglected aspects; namely that it is not just social scientists who are in the business of analysing social media, but users themselves. We explore how mainstream social media analytics research (1) overinflates the importance of sociological theories, concepts and methodologies (which do not typically feature in the accounts of social media users), (2) downplays the extent to which social media platforms already exhibit order prior to any sociological accounting of them, and, (3) thereby produces findings which explain social scientific perspectives rather than the phenomena themselves. We reformulate the ontological and epistemological basis of social media analytics research from a Wittgensteinian perspective concerned with what it makes sense to say about social media, as members of society and as researchers studying those members. Such a project aims to explore social media users' language as a practice embedded within the context of social life and online communication.

In doing so, I address a gap in social movement research identified by Earl et al. (2010). Online social movements, or e-movements, are notoriously understudied, which has contributed to disparate findings concerning Internet activism. I argue that online movements like Anonymous are fundamentally different from offline ones and require new theoretical models. While Earl et al.'s study focuses on research using resource mobilization theory, this study attempts to expand upon their notion by exploring a different theoretical model; the social movement life cycle. Based on my data, I find that the e-movement Anonymous does not fit with the existing life cycle model of social movements. As an e-movement, Anonymous possesses internal dynamics and external goals that are unique from offline movements and even from movements engaging in other types of Internet activism. I propose the theory of strategic abeyance to explain the continuous, adaptable, and dynamic nature of the Anonymous online movement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,SocIndex,-,,,,,,,,-

Although aggression among youth is not at all uncommon, street fights among urban Black girls garner a higher level of attention on social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram) and video sharing sites (e.g. WorldStarHipHop and YouTube). Many of these fights go ""viral"" with over a million online views, and internet users create ""memes"" (digital images or video clips) to dramatize and bring humor to what began as a localized, public altercation. In this paper, I conduct interpretive content analysis on a sample of WorldStarHipHop videos. I examine the politics of street fighting as it relates to actors, videographers, audience members, and public viewers. Ultimately, I argue that WorldStarHipHop participates in a problematic project of misrepresenting urban Black girls as exceptionally violent, reckless, and incorrigible. Rather than contextualizing racial and gender inequality faced by poor black and brown girls, WorldStarHipHop fetishizes violent encounters in urban spaces.

Simultaneously, Facebook and Twitter have become globally popular and get great influence not only in the virtual world but also in realistic society as the representative type of social media. Whether public intellectuals can expand social influence by using social media? I choose Chinese public intellectuals and Weibo (similar to Twitter in China) as research subjects to represent public intellectuals and social media and use text analysis method. It is found that 65.9% of Chinese public intellectuals have opened Weibo accounts, the average number of followers of their weibo is near to 900,000, and that of being shared and replied to their newest weibo has exceed to 1000. It is showed that public intellectuals broaden their scope of public influence by using weibo. But it is demonstrated in public's comment on their weibo that public opinion has divided into two different parts. Someone welcome public intellectuals and agree with their point, while someone disagree with their weiboes and even insult them. By using Bourdieu's field theory, 'public intellectuals win more public attention but lose public credibility' can be explained by fragmentation, populism, violent discourse as the distinctive rules of weibo field result in the totally different public evaluation. We cannot be too optimistic of public intellectual expanding social influence by using social media.

This derogatory term has been aggressively disseminated by the Chinese government, warning women that they will remain forever single if they do not marry by the time they turn 30. I argue that state-sponsored perpetuation of myths about ""leftover"" women work in conjunction with China's population control policy in an effort to marry off as many young, educated women as possible. The Chinese government views heterosexual marriage as the foundation of a ""harmonious society,"" which is considered essential to maintaining social stability in the midst of widespread inequality and discontent. China faces a looming demographic crisis of tens of millions of men who will be unable to find a bride because of the sex ratio imbalance - roughly 118 boys for every 100 girls -- caused by the abortion of female fetuses. My paper will explore some of the origins, consequences, and resistance to the state campaign about ""leftover"" women. (For example, many young, urban women in China marry in haste out of fear that they may become too old to find another partner.) I draw on in-depth interviews with over 30 women and 20 men in Beijing and Shanghai, content analysis of state media reports, and analysis of comments regarding ""leftover"" women on China's version of Twitter, Sina Weibo.

Differences, tensions and negotiations about gains and losses in this process also mark cultural points of departure and features deemed most significant about them. A US-German comparative study of digital media adoption in professional journalism reveals two tendencies that occur simultaneously but to different degree: 1) diversification of professionalism, which is accompanied by a media environment that is increasingly hybrid and 2) corroboration of professionalism, connected to tendencies of normalizing new technologies. Aside from similar experiences of accelerated news cycles, digital- and particularly social media adoption reflects distinct professional cultures and their responses to the crisis of traditional news media. German journalists in this study reproduced more than altered professional norms through social media while their advent shook the entire conception of what US journalists did, led them to adjust their occupational roles and expand their professional boundaries. Especially Twitter featured US reporters as allowing more transparency of practice. Findings are interpreted according to media systemic differences and distinct, culturally shaped positions journalism inhabits in these civil societies. This paper is based on ethnographic research of two groups of political reporters in the US and Germany. Field research stretched from spring of 2009 to summer of 2012, set at state governments in Albany, New York and Munich, Bavaria, involving participant observation, 72 interviews with journalists (from 31 different news organization) and spokespeople (across all political parties and branches of government).

Some preliminary studies suggest that social media has begun to blur the lines between private and public mourning, encouraging users to maintain continuing bonds with the deceased, and helping mourners establish community with one another. However, these early studies have primarily examined highly personalized social media spaces such as Facebook and MySpace. It is possible that the ways in which death and mourning is addressed and/or happens via social media sites varies according to the features of particular sites. In this paper, we analyze the tweet-feeds of deceased Twitter users and find that social processes surrounding death and mourning on Twitter are more diverse than early studies of social media suggest. We find that Twitter users engage in a unique blend of public and private behavior pertaining to death and mourning. While some users directly engage with the deceased and display evidence of ""continuing bonds"", others use Twitter to comment on ""high profile"" instances of death - often connecting these deaths to other topics of interest or broad discussions of death and mortality. Overall, our findings suggest that Twitter has broadened the scope of conversations about death and remembrance in contemporary Western culture by fostering social processes that embody a blend of interpersonal and broadcast-based communication. We categorize these processes along a spectrum that ranges from highly personal, intimate communications to broadcast-based, abstracted commenting.

The number of Internet users has increased greatly over the last decade, and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter claim hundreds of millions of users all over the world. A given user, however, may or may not be active (i.e., attending to events involving his or her alters and engaged in information transmission) at any given time, and the number of active users within a given community may vary greatly due to seasonal or other influences. Fluctuations in the size and composition of active user populations has important implications for phenomena such as information diffusion, resource mobilization, and the formation of citation networks; currently, however, little is known regarding active user population dynamics, nor their measurement. Here, we introduce a method for estimating the size of active user populations in an online environment over short time intervals (e.g., minutes to hours). Using a variant of the capturerecapture method (often used for animal populations), we take multiple samples from activityqueryable user populations (e.g., Twitter) and exploit the overlap of users between samples to estimate the total population of those who are active. Results from a large study of Twitter users show consistent and reliable estimates of active users of Twitter over time for many levels of resolution, from monthly to hourly. The estimates show a clear diurnal pattern of active user population, with daily and weekly patterns of active use. Further, with some extension, the method allows us to estimate mean degree of the active user population. Our findings suggest that this method is an effective and useful approach for estimating active user population dynamics in a variety of online social network settings.

Additionally, bots serve as social actors with the same capabilities of information transmission as humans, allowing for a network of bots to spread false information in a highly effective manner.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood. METHODS In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain. RESULTS Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level. CONTRIBUTION We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features. Linguistic analysis of social media data provides a middle ground between qualitative studies and more standard quantitative approaches.

Returning to Sacks' discussion of the 'MIR device', the paper demonstrates how members' produced and handled key 'facts' as inference-rich materials for making sense of the act itself, for attributing 'motive' and 'intention', and for formulating procedural and political consequentialities and alignments using the 'facts at hand'. The paper thus recommends online materials as a means to recover members' applications and use of the MIR device-in-action and as a means of avoiding stipulative or static 'grid-like' formulations of meaning, sense-making, and categorisation practices. In keeping with the conference theme, the paper also aims to highlight the contribution of an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic sensibility for the examination of the (political) contours of contemporary forms of social discrimination and control.

Scant research, however, considers the effects of particular uses of ubiquitous technologies as they link and facilitate micro and macro interactions, offline and online, and across private and public spheres. This study examines new forms of communication enabled by ubiquitous, internet-connected technologies, fusing two existing frameworks to account for norms of interaction: Goffman's frontstage and backstage regions for face-to-face communication, and Marwick and boyd's multiple audiences or publics in online Twitter networks. Drawing on data collected in quasi-public bar settings, we examine how bar patrons use new media technologies to broker intimacy with others and strategically collapse online and offline contexts to manage their own self perception in myriad ways. Our new theoretical model accounts for new media technologies' capability to ""tether"" interactions between offline and online planes of interaction, collapsing existing relations within and across dimensions of privacy in everyday contexts. We argue that ubiquitous, internet-connected technologies have altered Goffman's model for face-to-face interaction. More specifically, we argue that in the studied contexts the private, face-to-face ""backstage"" is shrinking, both literately and figuratively, and is likely changing how people both conceive of and achieve intimacy with others.

Much of this research, however, focuses more on opportunities made possible by shifts in the discourse of relatively privileged actors in the media, the professions, and/or elite policymaking fields. While such actors are undoubtedly influential, these studies neglect the relationships between movements and the dynamics of broader mass public discourse (especially using modern social media technologies), as well as the importance of ""media activism"" that takes place through political films, books, or other cultural products. We study these dynamics through an investigation of social movement influences on the passage of local moratoria against the controversial natural gas extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing (""fracking""). We use data from large-scale scrapes of social media discourse from Twitter and Google, evidence of where the controversial Gasland documentary was aired in public, and data culled from traditional news media, in addition to evidence of fracking activity from state disclosures. We find that (1) the Gasland documentary represented a significant influence upon anti-fracking activism, (2) that such activism, in turn, had a significant effect upon the passage of moratoria, (3) that Gasland significantly increased social media attention to fracking, and (4) that the civic capacity of local communities also encouraged the passage of fracking bans.

Drawing from theories of agency and the social construction of sexuality, this paper considers the internet's democratic and public platform to allow users to resist and transform norms surrounding female sexuality through hashtags, forums, blogs, and websites. I argue that the internet offers room for multiple voices and perspectives, asking whether these actions can change larger gender and sexual relations and structures. Findings reveal that the phrase ""slutshaming"" has entered the public vernacular, and terms such as ""slut"" and ""whore"" are being used in new ways on social media, but only some of these ways directly challenge the sexual double standard and attacks on women's sexual agency.

My approach is to frame Internet interaction within symbolic-interactionist, post-structuralist, and feminist theories. I interpret the use of misogyny terms, such as ""slut,"" as an effort to reaffirm entitlement over women's bodies and redraw normative heterosexual boundaries. Thus, the Internet serves as a power structure that defines women in relation to men, and enforces a dichotomous notion of women as worthy or unworthy. I examine the view that Internet misogyny is linked to women's increasing control over their sexuality and fertility, economic independence, and political rights. On the other hand, the Internet's democratic and public platform allows for opportunities for resistance and social change.

At times, this speech is direct, with messages emanating directly from government agencies. At other times governments compel speech by corporations--such as requiring warning labels on cans and bottles of alcohol and on cigarette packages. This paper examines government speech on alcohol in the United States. Examples include mandated warning labels on alcoholic beverages, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, and the Talk. They Hear You campaign. I point out the pronounced limitations of these examples of state speech. In the U.S., alcohol warning labels are relatively inconspicuous (they lack graphic images and are small), and carry constrained messages that do not rotate. Not surprisingly, there is little evidence of these warnings having behavioral effects. The major anti-drug campaign of the past 25 years--the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign--largely avoided the topic of alcohol. Evaluation results suggest that the campaign was relatively ineffective, and may have resulted, in some instances, in higher levels of substance use than otherwise would have been the case. While the new ""Talk. They Hear You"" Campaign has not yet been evaluated, it seems unlikely that it will have a significant impact at the population level, as it is quite small and relatively unambitious. I explore potential reasons for the weakness of government speech on alcohol in the U.S., as well as over-reliance on speech compared to potentially more effective policy instruments, such as regulation.

To date, these interactions have not been extensively studied; however, the increasing use of online communication channels by EMOs allows researchers a unique opportunity to observe their public communication dynamics in a time-resolved manner. Here, we observe dynamic interactions on the social microblogging site Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. Using relational event models, we find that dyadic exchange between public-facing organizations is common, despite what we might expect given a ""pure"" public-facing, unambiguous information deluge to the public.

This contribution examines the presence and diffusion of these emotions in populist online communications to gain insights into the formation of intergroup emotions. The study applies a lexical sentiment analysis of discrete emotions to a sample of 275.582 Twitter posts authored by officials of two German political parties frequently characterized as populist, the left-wing ""Die Linke"" and the right-wing ""Alternative f√ºr Deutschland"" (AfD), and to a baseline sample of 315,536 random posts. Using multilevel regression models, the study compares the presence of anger and fear cues across groups and analyzes associations between these cues and linguistic references to migrants and political elites. Also, the effect of expressed anger on the frequency by which posts are shared by their recipients is modeled. Results support the hypotheses that anger, and to a lesser extent fear, are dominant emotions in populist communications on Twitter, and that populists are more likely to evoke anger when referring to out-groups. Finally, the study shows that anger cues significantly increase the sharing of posts authored by populist actors. Since social sharing of emotions is thought to contribute to emotional alignment processes within groups and consequently to the strengthening of group identities, these findings do not only depict a strong resonance of emotionalized populist messages promoting out-group devaluation but also hint at their potential to foster in-group cohesion within populist online-collectives.

The present study contributes to the theoretical development of digital repertoires of contention by considering the applicability of Five Minute Activism and Fifth Estate Theory using the case of ""#TellVicEverything,"" an e-tactic Twitter users employed to oppose a lawful access bill (the Bill) in Canada in February 2012. Tracing the process of this e-tactic from initial opposition to the defeat of the Bill, this case study employs a mixed-methods approach. Content analysis which values assessment of basic units is joined with the reflexivity of interviews and sensitivity to social relationships of network analysis to enable a holistic approach. It is demonstrated that in this case a crucially important resource was the traditional media which is not explained by either Five Minute Activism or Fifth Estate Theory to date. Evidence suggests use of this e-tactic simultaneously reinforced the power of the traditional media while also claiming communicative power by contributing to the traditional media content production process. The main contribution of this study is theoretical, articulating causal mechanisms contributing to the success of a specific e-tactic. It is argued that access to resources and people should be considered in future studies of the digital repertoire and that the traditional media are an important resource and player in e-tactics.

In this paper, we first developed the concept of Cyber Public Sphere to describe the influence it has on spreading cyber moral panic and criminalizing undocumented immigrants in the United States. We argue that the Cyber Public Sphere is able to discuss the problems perceived and pass on the word to others. The immigrants are the folk devils and we argue that the public is able to discuss the problems and pass on the word to others about the problems brought by the folk devils and reach out more people to participate in political action against the folk devils through the utilization of the internet and social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. In addition, images and YouTube videos are used in which metaphors against the folk devils are represented. Then, we provide examples about how the Cyber Public Sphere functions to help spread the false claims. Finally, we list the strategies utilized by the public through the cyber public sphere to recruit others into fairing the folk devils so political action can be pursued against the folk devils.

This research examines factors that influence the retransmission of National Weather Service public messages on the online social network Twitter. Using a census of all messages published by the National Weather Service on Twitter from 2013 to the end of 2016, we identify message level ""micro-structural"" features and content factors that lead to the amplification or attenuation of these messages. For structural related features we find that the use of hashtags, photos or videos (media), and exclamation points increase the potential for retransmission, while mentioning other users, using a hyper-link to an outside source, and the use of question marks are associated with an attenuation of retransmission. In terms of content, it was found that the discussion of weather-related facts, instructions or action commands, and discussion of ongoing weather conditions amplifies messages, while discussion of future forecasts, weather product information, and community building messages attenuates message retransmission. Our findings support ideas posited by Gordon Allport and Leo Postman (1947) and Tamotsu Shibutani (1966) about what makes information more or less transmissible, as well as provides policy implications for hazard related organizations like the National Weather Service.

Nonetheless, this group has adopted social media as a major venue to inform other Americans about their religion and culture and use YouTube and Twitter to conduct social experiments, narrate first-person accounts, promote awareness, and engage in hash-tag activism. To examine this new medium of cross-cultural dialogue we conduct content media analysis of popular YouTube videos and viewer comments to analyze Arab and Muslim American youth's social media presence. The objective of this study is to explore how Arab and Muslim American youth respond to the inaccurate representations of Arab and Muslim culture in post-9/11 America. We examine five major themes: 1) mainstream media linking fear, crime, and terrorism to Arabs and Muslims, 2) the significance of physical markers associated with Arabs and Muslims, 3) America's practice of religious tolerance rather than religious acceptance of Islam, 4) notable political action and activism among Muslim young adults, and 5) the changing conceptualization of assimilation as it applies to Muslims in American society. We then discuss the implications of youth social media counter-narratives as challenging mainstream media representations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,SocIndex,-,,,,,,,,-

Methodologically, it utilizes the literature (journals and newspapers) and Twitter research. The paper addresses the impact and pervasiveness of English language translations in electronic communications. A bird's eye view of how the war metaphor spread during the pandemic is presented. Additionally, the paper discusses idiosyncratic differences, cultures and histories in an Anglo-Saxon country and a Latin one. The topic of how leaders in different countries used the war metaphor to regulate the activities of citizens and manage their own political realities is reviewed. The situation of immigrants during the pandemic is discussed. The paper includes manifestations of those differences in celebrations, and mourning relating to the pandemic. Recommendations for future research on the war metaphor and its effects on solidarity and the economy of nations are put forward.

These messages, known as 'tweets', can be sent by cell phone (as a text message), through the Internet, and through mobile Internet devices. Anyone with a cell phone or Internet access can be a regular Twitter user. Because of this diversity of contributors, news gathered from Twitter is considered by some to be less biased and more 'real' than other mediums. This paper examines the site's role in being the first to report on the Mumbai bomb blasts in 2008 and the downed US Airways flight in 2009 as case studies. This paper also explores the question of whether Twitter has transformed ordinary individuals into 'empowered' citizen journalists or whether their voices are merely subsumed by traditional media. Rather than selectively condemning Twitter as dumbed down or, on the other hand, praising it as profound, this paper poses important questions which explore the possibilities and pitfalls of this new medium and its impacts on social life. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that Twitter is a technology which is socially constituted and digital divides and social inequalities which exist offline persist online, stratifying both access to Twitter and the information flowing on the medium.

How are decentralized social media deployed as instruments by traditional social actors and political institutions? This article addresses these questions by analyzing the structuring context that links convergence and warfare. It focuses on the Alliance of Youth Movements, the State Department co-sponsored group that produced a web-hub of materials that distributed technical knowledge and social media skills for youth protestors around the world. Its effects were felt in Egypt's Arab Spring. At the same time, similar deployments of social media technologies by US domestic protestors have been considered a criminal use of a communication facility (e.g. Anonymous and the Tin Can Communications Collective's use of Twitter during 2009 G20 protests). Convergence produces hybrids, some of which are encouraged, mobilized and 'friended' while others are pre-empted, dissuaded and targeted as unspecified enemies by sovereign/network powers. We are witnessing a convergence of sovereign and network powers, one that expresses new modes of control while setting the conditions for new forms of evaluation and antagonism.
