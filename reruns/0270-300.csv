The efficient information diffusion in their communities ensures wide awareness of updated special events. With agent-based models built on the NetLogo platform, I study information diffusion on online social networks with different simulated network structures. Outcomes from simulated networks and from a case study of real-world Twitter networks show that there exist a range of paired optimal propagation parameters that could mimic real-world information diffusion. It is found that the physical space and the process of information diffusion on the real retweet network over time still demonstrate a geographic pattern showing that a local city or a related city is more involved in a special event in the area.

Using content analysis that combines both quantitative and qualitative method-ologies, we analysed the posts (N=386) uploaded to the official Instagram accounts of the main candidates for president of the Spanish government during the electoral campaigns for the two general elections held in 2019. This enabled us to meet the main objective of the study, which was to verify whether the Instagram platform is prone to hosting political messages and discussions of a populist nature. Likewise, in order to obtain a wider perspec-tive of both campaigns on the same social network, the issues forming the subject of each candidates' agendas in the same period were studied. The main results show that Instagram, like Twitter and Facebook, enables political leaders to spread messages that in essence carry a populist narrative; to use the social network as a means of electoral propaganda; and largely to avoid discussing the proposals of their political agendas.",SOCIAL MEDIA; POLITICAL COMMUNICATION; political leaders; FACEBOOK; populism; DISCOURSE; social networks; MEDIATIZATION; PARTIES; TWITTER; IMAGE; DISCURSIVE STRATEGY; general elections; GENERAL-ELECTION; thematic agenda,WOS,0,,,,,,,

Before the digital revolution, the relationship between the politician and the voter was intermediated by journalists and broadcast media. In contrast to traditional media, social media are presumed to enable politicians to engage directly with the electorate (Kruikemeier, Van Noort, Vliegenthart & De Vreese, 2015). In the last decade, there was a growing interest in the role of social media in election campaigns, triggered by Barack Obama's electoral presidential election victory in 2008 and more recently by Donald Trumps' triumph in 2016 (Rodriguez-Andres, 2018). The research presented in this article answers three main questions. First, who are the politicians using Twitter for campaigning purposes and what variables can predict Twitter use? Second, when do Belgian politicians use it and with which frequency? And third: do tweeting politicians perform better at the ballot box? The main findings reveal that a Flemish candidate has a higher probability of 18,7% to be present on Twitter compared to a candidate from the French community. Another important finding is that there is no significant association between the number of tweets and number of preferential votes, although a trend towards significance was observed for Flemish politicians.

In November 2020, we collected tweets on the COVID-19 pandemic with content ranging from safety measures, vaccination, health, to politics. We then tested different specifications of spatial econometrics models to relate the frequency of selected keywords with administrative data on COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results highlight how mentions of selected keywords can significantly explain future COVID-19 cases and deaths in one locality. We discuss two main mechanisms potentially explaining the links we find between Twitter contents and COVID-19 diffusion: risk perception and health behavior.

Traditional machine learning models may encounter problems when used in such a context, due to the peculiarities of microblogging sites and the manner in which these networks interact (both between themselves and with other networks). Moreover, state-of-the-art approaches have focused on non-transparent techniques that cannot be audited; so, despite the fact that they are top performing techniques, it is impossible to check if the models are actually fair. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised methodology that uses our Discriminatory Expressions algorithm for feature selection to detect expressions that are biased towards extremist content (Francisco and Castro 2020). With the help of human experts, the relevant expressions are filtered and used to retrieve further extremist content in order to iteratively provide a set of relevant and accurate expressions. These discriminatory expressions have been proved to produce less complex models that are easier to comprehend, and thus improve model transparency. In the following, we present close to 70 expressions that were discovered by using this method alongside the validation test of the algorithm in several different contexts.

ISIS also achieve this through publishing propaganda materials, such as the two online magazines Dabiq and Rumiyah (Heidarysafa et al. 2019). In this paper, our focus lies with the former. Through a transitivity analysis of three issues from Dabiq, this paper explores how the in-group (the believers) and the Other (the non-believers) are represented in the magazine. The transitivity framework is useful here because it exposes the linguistic choices that people make and, in turn, reveals how they perceive their world.

I have chosen a Muslim preacher who has been the owner of the most followed Twitter account in the Arab-Muslim world: Mohamad al-Arefe. At the time of my research, this Saudi Sunni preacher was ranked in the 83rd1 place in the global ranking of the most followed Twitter accounts in the world. This article aims to develop a typology of content shared on Twitter by al-Arefe. This research examines the way the Twitter platform is being used by this preacher, and it answers the question whether the theoretical model of religion mediatisation applies to the content shared by al-Arefe. This article combines two methodological approaches to study the content shared by al-Arefe on his Twitter account: a quantitative method and a qualitative one. I focus on the analysis of three elements present among the contents shared by this preacher on his Twitter account: Hashtags, visuals and links. Finally, my analysis shows how al-Arefe focuses more on his person and his image than he focuses on presenting Islamic teachings.

Researchers have raised concerns over the use of social media data in research (for example, boyd and Crawford, 2012; Housley et al, 2014; Tinati et al, 2014), exploring the ontological and epistemological grounding of the emerging field. We contribute to this debate by drawing on Wittgensteinian philosophy to elucidate hitherto neglected aspects; namely that it is not just social scientists who are in the business of analysing social media, but users themselves. We explore how mainstream social media analytics research (1) overinflates the importance of sociological theories, concepts and methodologies (which do not typically feature in the accounts of social media users), (2) downplays the extent to which social media platforms already exhibit order prior to any sociological accounting of them, and, (3) thereby produces findings which explain social scientific perspectives rather than the phenomena themselves. We reformulate the ontological and epistemological basis of social media analytics research from a Wittgensteinian perspective concerned with what it makes sense to say about social media, as members of society and as researchers studying those members. Such a project aims to explore social media users' language as a practice embedded within the context of social life and online communication. This reflects the everyday use of language as an evolving toolkit for undertaking social interaction, pointing towards an alternative conception of social media analytics.",Big Data; BIG DATA; CRISIS; CHALLENGES; social media analytics; epistemology; TWITTER; ontology; ordinary language philosophy; philosophy of social science; Wittgenstein,WOS,0,,,,,,,

The article raises the question about how researchers' subjective decisions affect the performance of supervised deep learning models. The aim is to deliver practical advice for researchers concerning: (1) whether it is more efficient to monitor coders' work to ensure a high quality training dataset or have every document coded once and obtain a larger dataset instead; (2) whether lemmatisation improves model performance; (3) if it is better to apply passive learning or active learning approaches; and (4) if the answers are dependent on the models' classification tasks. The models were trained to detect if a tweet is about current affairs or political issues, the tweet's subject matter and the tweet author's stance on this. The study uses a sample of 200,000 manually coded tweets published by Polish political opinion leaders in 2019. The consequences of decisions under different conditions were checked by simulating 52,800 results using the fastText algorithm (DV: F1-score). Linear regression analysis suggests that the researchers' choices not only strongly affect model performance but may also lead, in the worst-case scenario, to a waste of funds.

The aim of this paper is to develop a systemic risk model which, differently from existing ones, employs not only the information contained in financial market prices, but also big data coming from financial tweets. From a methodological viewpoint, we propose a new framework, based on categorical graphical models, that can estimate systemic risks with models based on two different sources: financial markets and financial tweets, and suggest a way to combine them, using a Bayesian approach. From an applied viewpoint, we present the first systemic risk model based on big data, and show that such a model can shed further light on the interrelationships between financial institutions. This can help predicting the level of returns of a bank, conditionally on the others, for example when a shock occurs in another bank.

The analysis shows that online networking yields a storage mechanism through which any individual contribution-e.g. a blog post, a comment, or a photo-is stored within a particular network and ready for virtual access by each member who connects to the network. When someone provides feedback, for example by commenting on a note, or by replying to a message, the interaction is finalized. These interactions are asynchronous, i.e. they allow individuals to relate in different moments, whenever they have time to. When the social environment is poor of participation opportunities and/or the pressure on time increases (for example due to the need to increase the working time), the stock of information and ties stored in the Internet can help individuals to defend their sociability.

The latter deems the Internet as a fragmented and individualized space, which, by definition, destroys any possibility of collective deliberation and discussion.

Through a quantitative-qualitative analysis, grounded on the digital methods paradigms and based on a dataset of 181085 tweets collected during the Primarie of Centro Sinistra 2012, we would like to show how Twitter can be conceived of as a civic device that permits a specific political discourse and new forms of political association to be materialized - both entities that would remain unseen otherwise.

The victims of this phenomenon are women for the simple fact that their aggressors do not recognize their minimum rights of freedom, respect and decisionmaking. At the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, the UN acknowledged that violence against women is an obstacle to achieving equality, development and peace and that it violates and violates human rights and fundamental freedoms. The UN defines the phenomenon as a manifestation of power relations between women and men that, as history shows us, have always been unequal. Social media, it comes in a variety of forms from the most popular like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to things like blogs, business networks and forums. Those who are active online within these social media platforms each and every month reach into billions of users. Accessibility is also becoming easier, as everyone can now connect via a mobile device. The reason behind social media, why do people share? First, many want to share the content they find, because it is entertaining or the information has value. Social media helps connect people, as well as helping to grow businesses. Another reason includes people using social media for causes and charities, sharing these because they feel strongly about a certain issue. This brings us to how social media can have an impact on the community and general society. Many of the problems in the world today have more exposure, therefore bringing increased awareness of issues. This is definitely a positive side to social media, but is there also a downside?

293,1609,journalArticle,2022.0,"Isomaa, R",YouTube Drama in an Atheist Public: A Case Study,SECULARISM & NONRELIGION,10.5334/snr.146,,"In late March 2019, British atheist YouTuber ""Rationality Rules"" published a video in which he argued that trans women should be excluded from women's sports. Accused of transphobia, he was denounced by a prominent atheist organization, which led to intense arguments in Anglophone atheist spaces on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, lasting throughout the year. This article uses the controversy, an instance ""YouTube drama,"" as an opportunity to investigate the ways in which an imagined ""atheist community"" is constructed through internal atheist conflict. Through critical discourse analysis of 157 YouTube videos, published between the end of March and the end of November, it identifies six different discursive formations, which affected the development of the drama and offer competing conceptions of the community. By utilizing Michael Warner's theory of 'publics' and tounterpublics,' spaces that exists only for the circulation of discourse, this study approaches the drama not as an interpersonal conflict, but as a battle over the norms of discourse within the atheist community. It suggests that a public lens is useful for understanding contemporary atheism, and that the nature of publics and counterpublics helps explain the dynamics of atheist disagreement on social issues.",YouTube; drama; RELIGION; atheism; publics; transphobia,WOS,-,,,,,,,

This paper aims to analyse the relationship between city residents' well-being and three established indicators: economic growth (as measured by GDP per capita), population size, and green space. A Big Data approach based on the lexica used on social media was proposed to develop well-being indicators. Using the 2016 data of Weibo (i.e. the Chinese version of Twitter), this study finds that the relationship between residents' well-being and GDP per capita and the relationship between residents' well-being and population size both form inverted U-shaped curves. Specifically, for poor cities, levels of well-being increase as GDP per capita increases. But after peaking at around the median GDP per capita point, levels of well-being drop as the city's economy continues to increase. Similarly, levels of well-being increase with population size for small cities, but decrease for those cities whose population sizes rank in the top quarter. In contrast, there is a positive relationship between well-being and the percentage of green space for all cities. Implications and future directions are discussed.",Well-being; Big Data; HEALTH; INCOME; Chinese social media; City level; Economic growth; Green space; Population size; LANGUAGE; HAPPINESS; GREEN SPACE; LIFE SATISFACTION,WOS,17,,,,,,,

Dynamic and multi-dimensional characteristics of QoL ask for new data sources to update the relevant indicators and novel methods for QoL assessment. This research presents a comprehensive framework for assessing QoL in intra-national level. To address current challenges, the focus has been on integrating subjective and objective criteria, using the geotagged Tweets as user-generated geo-contents (UGGCs) to extract some subjective criteria, and utilizing a multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the cumulative belief degree (CBD) method to integrate and provide the final output. The proposed framework is implemented to assess the QoL in the provinces of Iran as the case study. Based on the obtained results, Tehran has a better QoL status, while Sistan-and-Balouchestan and Kermanshah have rather unsuitable conditions compared to other provinces. Results show the potential of the UGGCs to cover the dynamic characteristics of QoL and to complement the official data. Also, the functional capabilities of the CBD method in integrating heterogeneous criteria, handling uncertainty, and suitably providing the final results of QoL assessment in different scenarios allow authorities to get a more comprehensive, realistic view on QoL issues. The proposed method of this research is a step toward an integrated assessment of QoL using the data shared by people in the location-based social networks which could be regarded as a novel and useful tool for administrators in the field of QoL.",Quality of life; SOCIAL MEDIA; Well-being; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; Geoinformatics; Geospatial analysis; Location-based social networks; Multi-criteria decision analysis; TWITTER; HAPPINESS; ENVIRONMENT; GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; URBAN LIFE,WOS,1,,,,,,,
