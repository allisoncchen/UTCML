Using digital ethnographic methods and content analysis, this paper examines sexual shaming on the social media site Twitter. Using social listening software, I track the frequency and contexts of keywords such as ""slut"" and ""whore."" ""Slut"" is the most feared insult for high school girls. Although there is a long history of sexual shaming, the Internet has the potential for far-reaching and long-lasting effects. My approach is to frame Internet interaction within symbolic-interactionist, post-structuralist, and feminist theories. I interpret the use of misogyny terms, such as ""slut,"" as an effort to reaffirm entitlement over women's bodies and redraw normative heterosexual boundaries. Thus, the Internet serves as a power structure that defines women in relation to men, and enforces a dichotomous notion of women as worthy or unworthy. I examine the view that Internet misogyny is linked to women's increasing control over their sexuality and fertility, economic independence, and political rights. On the other hand, the Internet's democratic and public platform allows for opportunities for resistance and social change. I conclude with a discussion of the personal and methodological difficulties facing researchers of online gender-based harassment.

Some preliminary studies suggest that social media has begun to blur the lines between private and public mourning, encouraging users to maintain continuing bonds with the deceased, and helping mourners establish community with one another. However, these early studies have primarily examined highly personalized social media spaces such as Facebook and MySpace. It is possible that the ways in which death and mourning is addressed and/or happens via social media sites varies according to the features of particular sites. In this paper, we analyze the tweet-feeds of deceased Twitter users and find that social processes surrounding death and mourning on Twitter are more diverse than early studies of social media suggest. We find that Twitter users engage in a unique blend of public and private behavior pertaining to death and mourning. While some users directly engage with the deceased and display evidence of ""continuing bonds"", others use Twitter to comment on ""high profile"" instances of death - often connecting these deaths to other topics of interest or broad discussions of death and mortality. Overall, our findings suggest that Twitter has broadened the scope of conversations about death and remembrance in contemporary Western culture by fostering social processes that embody a blend of interpersonal and broadcast-based communication. We categorize these processes along a spectrum that ranges from highly personal, intimate communications to broadcast-based, abstracted commenting.

This opens up new avenues for false information to be spread, as individual social actors are not bound to their own identity, enabling artificial social actors to influence the social space. Through software robots--also colloquially known as ""bots"", one can program software to mimic the behaviors of human social actors in a credible manner, allowing for the artificial inflation of support for a particular belief, idea, or agenda. Additionally, bots serve as social actors with the same capabilities of information transmission as humans, allowing for a network of bots to spread false information in a highly effective manner. The spread of false information at the hands of bot networks can have disastrous effects upon the hazard response space, as in some cases misinformation can mean the difference between life and death. The information found below is not a study in its own right, but rather preliminary findings and hypotheses drawn from these findings regarding the nature of bots in the hazard space, the influence of bot networks within the hazard space, as well as tactics employed by bot operators within the hazard space. These findings and hypotheses are the initial outcomes of an ongoing study surrounding the subject of bots within the hazard and disaster response social space, and are not wholly indicative of results of the study.

These messages, known as 'tweets', can be sent by cell phone (as a text message), through the Internet, and through mobile Internet devices. Anyone with a cell phone or Internet access can be a regular Twitter user. Because of this diversity of contributors, news gathered from Twitter is considered by some to be less biased and more 'real' than other mediums. This paper examines the site's role in being the first to report on the Mumbai bomb blasts in 2008 and the downed US Airways flight in 2009 as case studies. This paper also explores the question of whether Twitter has transformed ordinary individuals into 'empowered' citizen journalists or whether their voices are merely subsumed by traditional media. Rather than selectively condemning Twitter as dumbed down or, on the other hand, praising it as profound, this paper poses important questions which explore the possibilities and pitfalls of this new medium and its impacts on social life. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that Twitter is a technology which is socially constituted and digital divides and social inequalities which exist offline persist online, stratifying both access to Twitter and the information flowing on the medium.

This research examines factors that influence the retransmission of National Weather Service public messages on the online social network Twitter. Using a census of all messages published by the National Weather Service on Twitter from 2013 to the end of 2016, we identify message level ""micro-structural"" features and content factors that lead to the amplification or attenuation of these messages. For structural related features we find that the use of hashtags, photos or videos (media), and exclamation points increase the potential for retransmission, while mentioning other users, using a hyper-link to an outside source, and the use of question marks are associated with an attenuation of retransmission. In terms of content, it was found that the discussion of weather-related facts, instructions or action commands, and discussion of ongoing weather conditions amplifies messages, while discussion of future forecasts, weather product information, and community building messages attenuates message retransmission. Our findings support ideas posited by Gordon Allport and Leo Postman (1947) and Tamotsu Shibutani (1966) about what makes information more or less transmissible, as well as provides policy implications for hazard related organizations like the National Weather Service.

This contribution examines the presence and diffusion of these emotions in populist online communications to gain insights into the formation of intergroup emotions. The study applies a lexical sentiment analysis of discrete emotions to a sample of 275.582 Twitter posts authored by officials of two German political parties frequently characterized as populist, the left-wing ""Die Linke"" and the right-wing ""Alternative f√ºr Deutschland"" (AfD), and to a baseline sample of 315,536 random posts. Using multilevel regression models, the study compares the presence of anger and fear cues across groups and analyzes associations between these cues and linguistic references to migrants and political elites. Also, the effect of expressed anger on the frequency by which posts are shared by their recipients is modeled. Results support the hypotheses that anger, and to a lesser extent fear, are dominant emotions in populist communications on Twitter, and that populists are more likely to evoke anger when referring to out-groups. Finally, the study shows that anger cues significantly increase the sharing of posts authored by populist actors. Since social sharing of emotions is thought to contribute to emotional alignment processes within groups and consequently to the strengthening of group identities, these findings do not only depict a strong resonance of emotionalized populist messages promoting out-group devaluation but also hint at their potential to foster in-group cohesion within populist online-collectives.

The number of Internet users has increased greatly over the last decade, and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter claim hundreds of millions of users all over the world. A given user, however, may or may not be active (i.e., attending to events involving his or her alters and engaged in information transmission) at any given time, and the number of active users within a given community may vary greatly due to seasonal or other influences. Fluctuations in the size and composition of active user populations has important implications for phenomena such as information diffusion, resource mobilization, and the formation of citation networks; currently, however, little is known regarding active user population dynamics, nor their measurement. Here, we introduce a method for estimating the size of active user populations in an online environment over short time intervals (e.g., minutes to hours). Using a variant of the capturerecapture method (often used for animal populations), we take multiple samples from activityqueryable user populations (e.g., Twitter) and exploit the overlap of users between samples to estimate the total population of those who are active. Results from a large study of Twitter users show consistent and reliable estimates of active users of Twitter over time for many levels of resolution, from monthly to hourly. The estimates show a clear diurnal pattern of active user population, with daily and weekly patterns of active use. Further, with some extension, the method allows us to estimate mean degree of the active user population. Our findings suggest that this method is an effective and useful approach for estimating active user population dynamics in a variety of online social network settings.

State speech takes many forms, including government-sponsored reports, press releases, websites, billboards, advertisements in magazines and newspapers, television and radio media campaigns, graphic messages in and around commercial establishments (such as restaurants, bars, and gas stations), and, in the age of new media, ""tweets."" At times, this speech is direct, with messages emanating directly from government agencies. At other times governments compel speech by corporations--such as requiring warning labels on cans and bottles of alcohol and on cigarette packages. This paper examines government speech on alcohol in the United States. Examples include mandated warning labels on alcoholic beverages, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, and the Talk. They Hear You campaign. I point out the pronounced limitations of these examples of state speech. In the U.S., alcohol warning labels are relatively inconspicuous (they lack graphic images and are small), and carry constrained messages that do not rotate. Not surprisingly, there is little evidence of these warnings having behavioral effects. The major anti-drug campaign of the past 25 years--the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign--largely avoided the topic of alcohol. Evaluation results suggest that the campaign was relatively ineffective, and may have resulted, in some instances, in higher levels of substance use than otherwise would have been the case. While the new ""Talk. They Hear You"" Campaign has not yet been evaluated, it seems unlikely that it will have a significant impact at the population level, as it is quite small and relatively unambitious. I explore potential reasons for the weakness of government speech on alcohol in the U.S., as well as over-reliance on speech compared to potentially more effective policy instruments, such as regulation.

It reports on the analysis of materials gathered from Twitter during and following the reporting of the incident, and draws from on membership categorisation analysis in describing members' categorisational work in handling the 'facts' of the shooting as they emerged. Returning to Sacks' discussion of the 'MIR device', the paper demonstrates how members' produced and handled key 'facts' as inference-rich materials for making sense of the act itself, for attributing 'motive' and 'intention', and for formulating procedural and political consequentialities and alignments using the 'facts at hand'. The paper thus recommends online materials as a means to recover members' applications and use of the MIR device-in-action and as a means of avoiding stipulative or static 'grid-like' formulations of meaning, sense-making, and categorisation practices. In keeping with the conference theme, the paper also aims to highlight the contribution of an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic sensibility for the examination of the (political) contours of contemporary forms of social discrimination and control.

The present study contributes to the theoretical development of digital repertoires of contention by considering the applicability of Five Minute Activism and Fifth Estate Theory using the case of ""#TellVicEverything,"" an e-tactic Twitter users employed to oppose a lawful access bill (the Bill) in Canada in February 2012. Tracing the process of this e-tactic from initial opposition to the defeat of the Bill, this case study employs a mixed-methods approach. Content analysis which values assessment of basic units is joined with the reflexivity of interviews and sensitivity to social relationships of network analysis to enable a holistic approach. It is demonstrated that in this case a crucially important resource was the traditional media which is not explained by either Five Minute Activism or Fifth Estate Theory to date. Evidence suggests use of this e-tactic simultaneously reinforced the power of the traditional media while also claiming communicative power by contributing to the traditional media content production process. The main contribution of this study is theoretical, articulating causal mechanisms contributing to the success of a specific e-tactic. It is argued that access to resources and people should be considered in future studies of the digital repertoire and that the traditional media are an important resource and player in e-tactics.

While previous analyses have revealed that online shaming serves mostly to regulate female sexuality, a sizable portion of online interactions can be characterized as resistance to normative constructions of female sexuality. Drawing from theories of agency and the social construction of sexuality, this paper considers the internet's democratic and public platform to allow users to resist and transform norms surrounding female sexuality through hashtags, forums, blogs, and websites. I argue that the internet offers room for multiple voices and perspectives, asking whether these actions can change larger gender and sexual relations and structures. Findings reveal that the phrase ""slutshaming"" has entered the public vernacular, and terms such as ""slut"" and ""whore"" are being used in new ways on social media, but only some of these ways directly challenge the sexual double standard and attacks on women's sexual agency. I conclude with a discussion of the potential for online conversations to transform social relations and social structures at a time when women's basic bodily rights are being threatened politically.

To date, these interactions have not been extensively studied; however, the increasing use of online communication channels by EMOs allows researchers a unique opportunity to observe their public communication dynamics in a time-resolved manner. Here, we observe dynamic interactions on the social microblogging site Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. Using relational event models, we find that dyadic exchange between public-facing organizations is common, despite what we might expect given a ""pure"" public-facing, unambiguous information deluge to the public. While the organizations do self-organize into communicative roles, we also find that organizations may also embark in sense-making behavior among themselves, despite their stated purpose of issuing directives intended for the public at large.

I examine the politics of street fighting as it relates to actors, videographers, audience members, and public viewers. Ultimately, I argue that WorldStarHipHop participates in a problematic project of misrepresenting urban Black girls as exceptionally violent, reckless, and incorrigible.

Differences, tensions and negotiations about gains and losses in this process also mark cultural points of departure and features deemed most significant about them. A US-German comparative study of digital media adoption in professional journalism reveals two tendencies that occur simultaneously but to different degree: 1) diversification of professionalism, which is accompanied by a media environment that is increasingly hybrid and 2) corroboration of professionalism, connected to tendencies of normalizing new technologies. Aside from similar experiences of accelerated news cycles, digital- and particularly social media adoption reflects distinct professional cultures and their responses to the crisis of traditional news media. German journalists in this study reproduced more than altered professional norms through social media while their advent shook the entire conception of what US journalists did, led them to adjust their occupational roles and expand their professional boundaries. Especially Twitter featured US reporters as allowing more transparency of practice.

We examine five major themes: 1) mainstream media linking fear, crime, and terrorism to Arabs and Muslims, 2) the significance of physical markers associated with Arabs and Muslims, 3) America's practice of religious tolerance rather than religious acceptance of Islam, 4) notable political action and activism among Muslim young adults, and 5) the changing conceptualization of assimilation as it applies to Muslims in American society. We then discuss the implications of youth social media counter-narratives as challenging mainstream media representations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,SocIndex,0,,,,,,,

In doing so, I address a gap in social movement research identified by Earl et al. (2010). Online social movements, or e-movements, are notoriously understudied, which has contributed to disparate findings concerning Internet activism. I argue that online movements like Anonymous are fundamentally different from offline ones and require new theoretical models. While Earl et al.'s study focuses on research using resource mobilization theory, this study attempts to expand upon their notion by exploring a different theoretical model; the social movement life cycle. Based on my data, I find that the e-movement Anonymous does not fit with the existing life cycle model of social movements. As an e-movement, Anonymous possesses internal dynamics and external goals that are unique from offline movements and even from movements engaging in other types of Internet activism. I propose the theory of strategic abeyance to explain the continuous, adaptable, and dynamic nature of the Anonymous online movement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,SocIndex,0,,,,,,,

Media Activism, Discursive Opportunities and Local Opposition against Hydraulic Fracturing in the United States, 2010-2013.",Conference Papers -- American Sociological Association,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=111809402&site=ehost-live,"A variety of recent studies have emphasized the importance of ""discursive opportunities"" for a movement's capacity to achieve its political goals through contentious claims-making. Much of this research, however, focuses more on opportunities made possible by shifts in the discourse of relatively privileged actors in the media, the professions, and/or elite policymaking fields. While such actors are undoubtedly influential, these studies neglect the relationships between movements and the dynamics of broader mass public discourse (especially using modern social media technologies), as well as the importance of ""media activism"" that takes place through political films, books, or other cultural products. We study these dynamics through an investigation of social movement influences on the passage of local moratoria against the controversial natural gas extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing (""fracking""). We use data from large-scale scrapes of social media discourse from Twitter and Google, evidence of where the controversial Gasland documentary was aired in public, and data culled from traditional news media, in addition to evidence of fracking activity from state disclosures. We find that (1) the Gasland documentary represented a significant influence upon anti-fracking activism, (2) that such activism, in turn, had a significant effect upon the passage of moratoria, (3) that Gasland significantly increased social media attention to fracking, and (4) that the civic capacity of local communities also encouraged the passage of fracking bans. The results of this study bear implications not only for scholars of movement outcomes, but also for those interested in contested industries, organizational processes, environmental sociology and the politics of energy, and the role of technology and social media in the contemporary public sphere.

Scant research, however, considers the effects of particular uses of ubiquitous technologies as they link and facilitate micro and macro interactions, offline and online, and across private and public spheres. This study examines new forms of communication enabled by ubiquitous, internet-connected technologies, fusing two existing frameworks to account for norms of interaction: Goffman's frontstage and backstage regions for face-to-face communication, and Marwick and boyd's multiple audiences or publics in online Twitter networks. Drawing on data collected in quasi-public bar settings, we examine how bar patrons use new media technologies to broker intimacy with others and strategically collapse online and offline contexts to manage their own self perception in myriad ways. Our new theoretical model accounts for new media technologies' capability to ""tether"" interactions between offline and online planes of interaction, collapsing existing relations within and across dimensions of privacy in everyday contexts. We argue that ubiquitous, internet-connected technologies have altered Goffman's model for face-to-face interaction. More specifically, we argue that in the studied contexts the private, face-to-face ""backstage"" is shrinking, both literately and figuratively, and is likely changing how people both conceive of and achieve intimacy with others.

This derogatory term has been aggressively disseminated by the Chinese government, warning women that they will remain forever single if they do not marry by the time they turn 30. I argue that state-sponsored perpetuation of myths about ""leftover"" women work in conjunction with China's population control policy in an effort to marry off as many young, educated women as possible. The Chinese government views heterosexual marriage as the foundation of a ""harmonious society,"" which is considered essential to maintaining social stability in the midst of widespread inequality and discontent. China faces a looming demographic crisis of tens of millions of men who will be unable to find a bride because of the sex ratio imbalance - roughly 118 boys for every 100 girls -- caused by the abortion of female fetuses. My paper will explore some of the origins, consequences, and resistance to the state campaign about ""leftover"" women. (For example, many young, urban women in China marry in haste out of fear that they may become too old to find another partner.) I draw on in-depth interviews with over 30 women and 20 men in Beijing and Shanghai, content analysis of state media reports, and analysis of comments regarding ""leftover"" women on China's version of Twitter, Sina Weibo.

Motivated by this, the overarching objective of this paper is to advance our understanding of how the public responds to mass shooting events in such media outlets. Specifically, it aims to examine whether distinct information seeking patterns emerge over time and space, and whether associations between public mass shooting events emerge in online activities and discourse. Towards this objective, we study a sequence of five public mass shooting events that have occurred in the United States between October 2017 and May 2018 across three major dimensions: the public's online information seeking activities, the media coverage, and the discourse that emerges in a prominent OSN. To capture these dimensions, respectively, data was collected and analyzed from Google Trends, LexisNexis, Wikipedia Page views, and Twitter. The results of our analysis suggest that distinct temporal patterns emerge in the public's information seeking activities across different platforms, and that associations between an event and its preceding events emerge both in the media coverage and in OSNs. Policy Implication: Studying the evolution of discourse in OSNs provides a valuable lens to observe how society's views on public mass shooting events are formed and evolved over time and space. The ability to analyze such data allows tapping into the dynamics of reshaping and reframing public mass shooting events in the public sphere and enable it to be closely studied and modeled. A deeper understanding of this process, along with the emerging associations drawn between such events, can then provide policy and decision‚Äêmakers with opportunities to better design policies and communicate the significance of their goals and objectives to the public.

How are decentralized social media deployed as instruments by traditional social actors and political institutions? This article addresses these questions by analyzing the structuring context that links convergence and warfare. It focuses on the Alliance of Youth Movements, the State Department co-sponsored group that produced a web-hub of materials that distributed technical knowledge and social media skills for youth protestors around the world. Its effects were felt in Egypt's Arab Spring. At the same time, similar deployments of social media technologies by US domestic protestors have been considered a criminal use of a communication facility (e.g. Anonymous and the Tin Can Communications Collective's use of Twitter during 2009 G20 protests). Convergence produces hybrids, some of which are encouraged, mobilized and 'friended' while others are pre-empted, dissuaded and targeted as unspecified enemies by sovereign/network powers. We are witnessing a convergence of sovereign and network powers, one that expresses new modes of control while setting the conditions for new forms of evaluation and antagonism.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood. METHODS In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain. RESULTS Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level. CONTRIBUTION We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features. Linguistic analysis of social media data provides a middle ground between qualitative studies and more standard quantitative approaches.
