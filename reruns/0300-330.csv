The two Facebook datasets are best described by a four-layer structure and the Twitter dataset by a five-layer structure. The absolute sizes of these layers and the mean frequencies of contact with alters within each layer match very closely the observed values from offline networks. In addition, all three datasets reveal the existence of an innermost network layer at similar to 1.5 alters. Our analyses thus confirm the existence of the layered structure of ego-centric social networks with a very much larger sample (in total, >185,000 egos) than those previously used to describe them, as well as identifying the existence of an additional network layer whose existence was only hypothesised in offline social networks.

However, the effectiveness of those strategies is unclear. This study thereby examined how national health departments deployed persuasive strategies to promote citizen engagement in COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets in six countries, including the UK, the US, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and India. Guided by the heuristic-systematic model and the health belief model, we found that national health departments differed significantly in the use of systematic-heuristic cues and health belief constructs in COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets. Generally, the provision of scientific information and appeals to anecdotes and fear positively, while appeals to bandwagon negatively, predicted citizen engagement. Messages about overcoming barriers and promoting vaccine benefits and self-efficacy positively affected engagement. Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate demonstrated negative impacts. Importantly, health departments across countries often used futile or detrimental strategies in tweets. A locally adapted evidence-based approach for COVID-19 vaccination persuasion was discussed. ‚Ä¢ Health departments often used detrimental tactics in promoting COVID-19 vaccines. ‚Ä¢ Appeals to facts, anecdotes, and fear promoted citizen engagement. ‚Ä¢ Appeals to bandwagon reduced citizen engagement. ‚Ä¢ Messages about efficacies and benefits promoted citizen engagement. ‚Ä¢ Emphases of COVID-19 threats and cues to vaccinate harmed citizen engagement.

While previous literatures have been 'sanitized' to emphasize the importance of managing optimal physiological health and safety, we would like to argue that keener attention is needed to rethink the constitutive role of bodies in co-producing a city's sociopolitical ecologies at this time of crisis. The main body is divided into three sections. The first section introduces the political dimensions of pandemic response by various governments with an emphasis to experiences of middle to low income countries. Our intention is to show how these studies bring into light the role of local politics of pandemic response within countries, and that actual governance mechanisms in cities are shaped and contested by shifting power blocs and emergent affinities. The second section forwards an embodied urban political approach that conceptualizes bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure. In this view, bodies-in-waiting is produced and reproduced by complex social-material flows and transformation rooted in variegated matrices of power through which urban spaces are (re)assembled. The last section demonstrates a sample case that shows how bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are understood using Twitter-sourced data associated with the Philippine government's disciplinary quarantine measures which started March 12, 2020 in the NCR. At its core, bodies-in-waiting as infrastructures populate a politically affirmative urban imaginary of bodies living on despite the existence of an accelerated and mutating virus in slower moving cities. ‚Ä¢ A conceptual innovation of bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure. ‚Ä¢ Bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are assembled in contested moral fields. ‚Ä¢ Bodies-in-waiting as infrastructure are politically affirmative spaces of living on. ‚Ä¢ Application of concept in understanding disciplinary quarantine measures.

This article investigates the phenomenon of the Egyptian diaspora through an innovative approach based on an analysis of the digital activity and the presence of Egyptian connected migrants. Following the methodology of the e-Diaspora project, we found a weakly connected network of websites, with many isolated nodes, little clusterization and no authorities or hubs. The fact that the traditional approach of the e-diaspora yielded few results prompted us to follow a new research strategy combining data from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. Because of a particularly fortuitous coincidence with the Egyptian revolt, we could investigate the mobilization of Egyptian migrants in pursuit of their voting rights on the micro-blogging platform Twitter. Through Twitter data, we identified links that were not visible through traditional Web-mapping techniques, and we could observe the emergence of a transnational Egyptian community debating and fighting for a common cause.

Though social media's role in times of crisis has been previously studied, much of this work tends to focus on first-responders and relief organizations. However, social media use during disasters tends to be decentralized and this organizational structure can promote different types of messages to top-down information systems. Using 142,786 geo-tagged tweets collected before and after Hurricane Sandy's US landfall as a case study, this article seeks to explore shifts in social media behavior during disruptive events and highlights that though Sandy disrupted routine life within Twitter, users responded to the disaster by employing humor, sharing photos, and checking into locations. We conclude that social media use during disruptive events is complex and understanding these nuanced behaviors is important across the social sciences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The increasing popularity of social media raises a number of questions regarding why we use it so much and what aspects influence this activity. What about gender? What about education, income, age or social status? This paper answers some of these questions using statistical analyses and by dividing overall social media use into selected social media, i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitter. The analysis used a dataset that contains information related to 2002 respondents from the U.S. and their social media activity. The results show that people with high household incomes and high education use social media the most. As age increases, social media use decreases, while bigger household income means that social media are used more. Overall, understanding where and at what frequency users are on social media can be a key competitive advantage.

For just as long, some Black women have resisted their mischaracterizations. Instead they have embraced a 'fat' identity. But little research has demonstrated how Black fat women participate in sport. The purpose of this study is to show how Black fat women who run use social media to unapologetically celebrate Blackness and fatness. This research uses a case-study approach to illuminate a broader phenomenon of decolonial resistance through running. In addition to analysis of websites, blogs, and news articles devoted to Black women's running, we discuss the (social) media content of two specific runners: Mirna Valerio and Latoya Shauntay Snell. We performed a critical discourse analysis on 14 media offerings from the two runners, including websites, Twitter pages, and blogs collected over a five-month period from September 2020-January 2021. The analysis examined how they represent themselves and their communities and how they comment on issues of anti-fat bias, neoliberal capitalism, ableist sexism, and white supremacy, some of the pillars of colonialism. Whereas running is often positioned as a weight-loss-focused and white-dominated colonial project, through their very presence and use of strategic communication to amplify their experiences and build community, these runners show how being a Black fat female athlete is an act of decolonial resistance. This study offers a unique sporting example of how fat women challenge obesity discourses and cultural invisibility and how Black athletes communicate anti-racist, decolonial principles.",MEDIA; POLITICS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; HEALTH; sport; critical discourse analysis; women; NEOLIBERALISM; OBESITY; BODY-IMAGE; CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; decolonize; fatness; running; SPEAKING; WEIGHT,WOS,0,,,,,,,
321,1808,journalArticle,2022.0,"Caliendo, G",Vaccine Nationalism or 'Brexit Dividend'? Strategies of Legitimation in the EU-UK Post-Brexit Debate on COVID-19 Vaccination Campaigns,SOCIETIES,10.3390/soc12020037,,"The initial stage of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been slow-moving and marred by supply disruptions in the EU. These problems have triggered severe criticism toward the institutions and highlighted a stark contrast compared to Britain's vaccination campaign, which, at the beginning of 2021, was one of the fastest in the continent. In the ensuing debate between the EU and the UK on their uneven vaccination rates, the Brexit argument has been repeatedly invoked: Some political commentators have argued that the reason why COVID-19 vaccination campaign could run so smoothly in Britain is that the country was not held back by the EU's slow approval process. This paper observes the way in which Britain emphasized its blistering vaccination pace to deflect criticism against Brexit. From a discursive perspective, Britain's vaccine success was used to vindicate the Brexit project, providing a new argument in favour of its indispensable and timely nature. At the other end of a binary rhetoric, the EU officials attempted to shatter confidence in the 'British vaccine', while also depositing blame on other factors triggering the EU's delay, such as the shortage of pharmaceutical supplies. The analytical part of this paper foregrounds strategies of discursive legitimation to observe how, and to what extent, the Brexit debate is being reshaped in UK and EU media by looking at a corpus of political tweets. The rhetorical strategies adopted by UK political leaders and EU officials to (de)legitimise national and supranational choices with reference to the COVID-19 vaccination campaign are observed through the lens of Critical Discourse Analysis as it embraces the idea that discursive acts are in dialectical relation to the social and institutional structures in which they are framed.",CRISIS; legitimation strategies; DISCOURSES; discourse studies; discursive articulations of Brexit; EU-UK debate on COVID-19 vaccination campaign; IMAGINARY; political and institutional tweets; REFERENDUM,WOS,2,,,,,,,

Microblogging sites are being used by people across the globe to share their opinions and to express sentiments for everything in real time. Through social listening, companies analyse the sentiments to assess the way forward, and the researchers use it to analyse the trend or an event and give forward-looking recommendations. The objective of the paper is to analyse the sentiments of people relating to Paytm IPO which can be used to predict the way forward. Design/methodology/approach. The study attempts sentiment analysis. For this purpose, QSR NVIVO 12, the qualitative analysis tool was used to retrieve the tweets from the Twitter website. NCapture was installed for this purpose. Post data cleaning, stemming, query augmentation and classification, the Twitter data was analysed. Findings. The sentiments around the IPO of Paytm have been negative and sarcastic. The extremely negative tweets were near twice the number of extremely positive tweets. Practical implication. The study can help an investor in evaluating the investment that they might be planning in the given company. For the company, whose IPO is being considered, an analysis of the sentiments around the IPO can help in taking corrective measures, if the sentiment is negative, towards reputation building. Originality/value. The study is an original contribution to the extant literature in the field of sentiment analysis.

Although the nonstandard form has been labeled in the literature as a calque of Spanish tener que + infinitive 'to have to', it appears in Twitter messages in all of the dialects analyzed. In fact, in our sample there are dialects in which tenir que occurs more frequently than haver de. Grammatical person of the verb used (haver or tenir) is also analyzed as a factor behind the choice of modal periphrasis. Multivariate analysis has been employed, determining that both of these factors (dialect and grammatical person) are statistically significant. The results of the multivariate analysis allow us to apply van Coetsem's (1988) theoretical framework in an attempt to describe the language contact situation in the different dialects. Source-language (sl) agentivity appears to be at work in the dialects where the nonstandard variant is prevalent, while recipient-language (rl) agentivity could be behind the use of the standard variant in the other dialects.

This paper focuses on the empirical assessment of various dimensions of the ¬´quality¬ª of online public argumentation and proposes a methodology to test various qualitative aspects of online public debates, like the dialogical/mono-logical orientation, the argumentative richness/ poverty, the eventual presence of logical and discursive fallacies. To concretely show the implementation of the method, its potentialities and limitations, the outcomes of an analysis carried out on arguments pro and against Europe on the Twitter platform @ debatingeurope are displayed and discussed.

Our paper reflects on the increased use of social media and empowerment among low-income students (Micheli 2016) and the increasing technological disadvantage that is created when using social media among lowincome and non-traditional students (Greenhow, Walker, and Kim 2009). We examine areas of discomfort among low-income, non-traditional, and minority students, including the lack of technology and internet connectivity in the students' households before college, abuse in social media, creating community and networks, and proper and improper usage of social media. We also argue that teaching of social media use that does not address these areas of discomfort may exacerbate cumulative disadvantages (Diprete and Eirich 2006). We examine how one's background plays a role in creating comfort and discomfort using social media. We provide strategies based on years of experience and past surveys of empowering all students in the classroom by using social media related to our primary teaching areas: race, health, culture, and methods.

Yet these new data sources lack critical information about the broader social context of collective behavior‚Äîor protect it behind strict privacy barriers. In this article, I introduce social media survey apps (SMSAs) that adjoin computational social science methods with conventional survey techniques in order to enable more comprehensive analysis of collective behavior online. SMSAs (1) request large amounts of public and non-public data from organizations that maintain social media pages, (2) survey these organizations to collect additional data of interest to a researcher, and (3) return the results of a scholarly analysis back to these organizations as incentive for them to participate in social science research. SMSAs thus provide a highly efficient, cost-effective, and secure method for extracting detailed data from very large samples of organizations that use social media sites. This article describes how to design and implement SMSAs and discusses an application of this new method to study how nonprofit organizations attract public attention to their cause on Facebook. I conclude by evaluating the quality of the sample derived from this application of SMSAs and discussing the potential of this new method to study non-organizational populations on social media sites as well.
