Ubiquitous visual technologies, the possibility to distribute and use images from heterogeneous sources across different social contexts and publics, and increasingly powerful facial recognition tools afford new avenues for law enforcement. Concurrently, these changes also trigger fundamental concerns about privacy violations and all-encompassing surveillance. Using the example of police investigations after the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, the present article provides insights into how different actors in the political and public realm in Germany deal with these potentials and tensions in handling visual data. Based on a qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles (n=42), tweets (n=267), experts‚Äô reports (n=3), and minutes of parliamentary debates and committee hearings (n=8), this study examines how visual data were collected, analyzed, and published and how different actors legitimated and contested these practices. The findings show that combined state, corporate, and privately produced visual data and the use of facial recognition tools allowed the police to cover and track public life in large parts of the inner city of Hamburg during the summit days. Police authorities characterized visual data and algorithmic tools as objective, trustworthy, and indispensable evidence-providing tools but black-boxed the heterogeneity of sources, the analytical steps, and their potential implications. Critics, in turn, expressed concerns about infringements of civic rights, the trustworthiness of police authorities, and the extensive police surveillance capacities. Based on these findings, this article discusses three topics that remained blind spots in the debates but merit further attention in discussions on norms for visual data management and for governing visibility: (1) collective responsibilities in visibility management, (2) trust in visual data and facial recognition technologies, and (3) social consequences of encompassing visual data collection and registered faceprints.

Successful gamification practices are reliant on encouraging playful subjectivities so that users voluntarily expose their personal information, which is then used to drive behavioural change (e.g. weight loss, workplace productivity, educational advancement, consumer loyalty, etc.). The pleasures of play, the promise of a 'game', and the desire to level up and win are used to inculcate desirable skill sets and behaviours. Gamification is rooted in surveillance; providing real-time feedback about users' actions by amassing large quantities of data and then simplifying this data into modes that easily understandable, such as progress bars, graphs and charts. This article provides an introduction to gamification for surveillance scholars. I first provide brief definitions of gamification, games and play, linking the effectiveness of gamification to the quantification of everyday life. I then explain how the quantification in gamification is different from the quantification in both analog spaces and digital non-game spaces. Next, I draw from governmentality studies to show how quantification is leveraged in terms of surveillance. I employ three examples to demonstrate the social effects and impacts of gamified behaviour. These examples range from using self-surveillance to gamify everyday life, to the participatory surveillance evoked by social networking services, to the hierarchical surveillance of the gamified call-centre. Importantly, the call-centre example becomes a limit case, emphasizing the inability to gamify all spaces, especially those framed by work and not play. This leads to my conclusion, arguing that without knowing first what games and play are, we cannot accurately respond to and critique the playful surveillant technologies leveraged by gamification.

This paper argues that closely examining content created by others and looking at one's own content through other people's eyes, a common part of social media use, should be framed as social surveillance. While social surveillance is distinguished from traditional surveillance along three axes (power, hierarchy, and reciprocity), its effects and behavior modification is common to traditional surveillance. Drawing on ethnographic studies of United States populations, I look at social surveillance, how it is practiced, and its impact on people who engage in it. I use Foucault's concept of capillaries of power to demonstrate that social surveillance assumes the power differentials evident in everyday interactions rather than the hierarchical power relationships assumed in much of the surveillance literature. Social media involves a collapse of social contexts and social roles, complicating boundary work but facilitating social surveillance. Individuals strategically reveal, disclose and conceal personal information to create connections with others and tend social boundaries. These processes are normal parts of day-to-day life in communities that are highly connected through social media.

In the first part, the authors show how most of the commentators have considered online gifting as an alternative to the classical market economy. Yet the recent (re)territorialization of the web challenges this perspective. As a consequence, the internet can no longer be considered a reply to capitalism. In the second part, the authors argue that in anthropology and social philosophy the term ‚Äògift‚Äô has often been used improperly, and that gift exchange has nothing to do with goods exchange, but with mutual recognition. In the third part, they use this definition to stress the importance of gift circulation through Facebook‚Äôs ‚ÄòLike‚Äô button and the Twitter feature called ‚ÄòMention‚Äô. In conclusion, the authors deal with the ‚ÄòLike economy‚Äô, i.e. the interference between gift exchange and market economy which is daily at work online.

The most important infrastructural element of this information society is the internet which enables dissemination of information in a very efficient and effective way, independent from the physical proximity between two networked computers. The internet is nonhierarchical (horizontal) in the sense that it does not have an ultimate power center which determines the structure of the networks and the contents that flow within and between networks. The formation of the networks and the content of information disseminated through them are shaped by the users. Hence, the interplay between internet and individuals is bidirectional; individuals structure the networks and the structure of networks, in turn, shapes the perception of individuals regarding self, community, and time. This paper analyzes how and why people use Twitter‚Äîboth a social networking site and a micro-blogger; to what extent Twitter use reflect the constituting principles of contemporary society such as conception of time and how it may affect our notion of community and social relations. It argues that Twitter represents a replica of hypermodern society with the apprehension of time streaming embedded in its use, clustering of users around personal and professional communities and centers and the strategies that users develop in order to deal with the complexity of online hypermodernity. Twitter, and social network sites in general, are structured by the values and conceptions of the contemporary society and we need to consider them within a greater zeitgeist. The main function of these services is to reinforce and enhance the conceptions and experience of hypermodernity and to increase the rate of social change further.

The results show that candidates did not use social media to portray their personal side, humanise their image and create their image of a leader through references to their skills and qualities. Rather, this research shows that in spite of the growing importance of social media, and the willingness and skill of the politicians in employing social media, traditional media, such as newspapers, remain indispensable for providing information about political issues to citizens in this new democracy during presidential elections.

In cities, urban green spaces are believed to provide many benefits to urban populations in terms of mental and emotional well-being. Through a case study of 60 urban green spaces in Birmingham, United Kingdom, this article investigates the spatial and temporal variation of the emotions experienced by individuals whilst using urban green spaces. Using a dataset obtained from Twitter as the basis for emotional explorations, sentiment analysis was performed on over 10,000 tweets to ascertain the positivity/negativity of individuals. Positive responses were more common than negative responses across all seasons, with happiness and appreciation of beauty being the common positive emotions identified. For the negative responses, fear and anger were present in similar amounts, with fewer tweets indicating sadness and disgust. Our findings show that Twitter data is a viable source of information to researchers investigating human interaction and emotional response to space in cities. Such information has implications for urban planners and park managers, enabling the creation of evidence-based spaces which enhance positive outdoor experience. Limitations in using Twitter data are discussed and these should be considered in future research.

New communication technologies create new opportunities to people to share their thoughts and works, and they also provide a media where sharing and discussions took place. Unlike traditional mass media, social media creates a rapidly growing domain. The term social media covers online tools and web sites where the users interact each other by sharing their knowledge, ideas and areas of interest. With communication opportunities, which are brought by social media, the institutions and organizations can reach their target masses easily, and broadcast their messages smoothly. Social media tools are also effective in providing rapid and participatory intra-institutional communication. As a part of social media, social networking is not only an area of interpersonal communication, but it also reflects a new public space feature of internet. Non-governmental organizations also use social media to discuss their issues, spread the messages, and activate their members and supporters. In this study, besides the concept of social media and data of non-governmental organizations' use of social media; data of communication activities of two women's associations serving in Konya are presented. In the conclusion of the study, parallel to the associations' efforts to take part in printed media, their existence in social media is also questioned.
