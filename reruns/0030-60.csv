Increasing use of social media by health professionals provides an opportunity to foster destigmatization. However, little is known about stigmatization and destigmatization within health professional social media Accordingly, this study investigates the use of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language in four Twitter communities: Medical, Public Health, Epidemiology, and Mental Health. Using a dataset of 33,981 tweets discussing opioids within these communities, we analyzed tweets for evidence of stigmatizing or destigmatizing language. Use of stigmatizing language is generally low and use of destigmatizing language is variable across communities. Additionally, there are measurable changes in language use on quarterly bases between 2009 and 2021. Mental Health shows a 7.1% quarterly reduction in the frequency of tweets with stigmatizing language (IRR = 0.928, 95% CI 0.877 to 0.984, p =.0159). Mental Health also shows a 5% quarterly increase in the frequency of destigmatizing tweets (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02‚Äì1.09, p =.00258). Medical Twitter experienced a 37% quarterly increase in destigmatizing tweet frequency (IRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.15‚Äì1.64, p =.00291), and Public Health a 16% increase (IRR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.11‚Äì1.20, p =0.00000000373). Unfortunately, a regression discontinuity design shows a decrease in Public Health's use of destigmatizing language since the emergence of COVID-19. While the longitudinal findings are promising, they also indicate a need for increased efforts to encourage broader use of destigmatizing language, especially post-COVID.

It examines the level of social media adoption by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in protecting Filipino nationals abroad. The popularity of social networking sites among Filipinos, including DFA officials and staff, played a vital role in influencing the institution's move toward social media adoption. Key informant interviews were conducted with 10 officials, case officers, and staff at the DFA home office and Foreign Service Posts in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from June to July 2019. While Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter can be effective tools for speedy communication between the DFA and OFWs, the DFA faces several challenges such as budgetary constraints, lack of human resources with ICT skills, and verifying reports, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the indispensable role of social media platforms in communicating with OFWs and in extending assistance to those in distress. Hence, the DFA may consider the formulation of an agency-wide social media strategy and collaboration with other migration authorities on social media-anchored projects.

The 1992 protests in Los Angeles following the death of Rodney King are one example of public response to an instance of excessive use of force. More recently, the death of George Floyd led to widespread protests against excessive use of force and the current model of policing in general. The increasing popularity and availability of social media over the past decade have made it a powerful tool for mobilizing citizens and provided a place for protest. This study looks at the negative reactions of social media users to police use of force in the United States based on analysis of two significant instances: the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. Using quantitative, forensic linguistics, and advanced topic modelling methodologies, three prominent aspects of policing identified in the literature ‚Äì excessive use of force, racial bias, and legitimacy ‚Äì were analysed from 14 days of tweets following each event. Analyses deal with trends in frequency, case similarities, and topic modelling. The results show important differences in negative online reaction to the two events, particularly regarding excessive use of force: those following the Floyd death focused on the technicalities of the intervention, while those responding to the Blake death focused on its aftermath. Analysis of tweets related to racial bias and police legitimacy revealed similar patterns, with users repeating criticisms such as differential treatment according to race and the need for changes in the policing model. The results also suggest that perceptions of excessive use of force and racial bias are deeply intertwined. Implications and issues are discussed.

Together, these women have served as an aspirational tableau for other Russian women trying to navigate their own roles of mothers and businesswomen. This article examines how these ""czarinas"" have constructed their perceived social media identities as wives and mothers to create a relationship with their followers that allows the czarinas to influence their purchasing decisions.

This study examines tweets by 10 authors, using corpus linguistic tools to find stylistic patterns characteristic of the corpus as a whole or of individual authors. The article then looks at tweets by others that mention the authors or use quotations from the authors in new contexts, creating an online presence for authors whether they tweet themselves or not. Authors are subject to the same tension between ordinariness and specialness that others have noted with stars in music, television, film, or fashion. Literature, because of its assumed cultural position, and its production in private, has sometimes been seen as being apart from and opposed to the cultural system of celebrity and promotion. But this cultural position also means the ordinariness of authors is treated as surprising and interesting, while the specialness makes them available to all as oracles.

Findings indicate that the mass killers received approximately $75 million in media coverage value, and that for extended periods following their attacks they received more coverage than professional athletes and only slightly less than television and film stars. In addition, during their attack months, some mass killers received more highly valued coverage than some of the most famous American celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, and Jennifer Aniston. Finally, most mass killers received more coverage from newspapers and broadcast/cable news than the public interest they generated through online searches and Twitter seems to warrant.

What is often understood as social media via social network sites is also a form of presentation of the self and produces this new hybrid among the personal, interpersonal and the mediated - what I am calling 'presentational media'. Via Facebook, MySpace, Friendster and Twitter individuals engage in an expression of the self that, like the celebrity discourse of the self, is not entirely interpersonal in nature nor is it entirely highly mediated or representational. This middle ground of self-expression - again partially mediated and partially interpersonal (and theoretically drawing from Erving Goffman's work) - has produced an expansion of the intertextual zone that has been the bedrock of the celebrity industry for more than half a century and now is the very centre of the social media networks of the internet and mobile media. The article investigates this convergence of presentation of the self through a study of social network patterns of presentation of celebrities and the very overcoded similarity in the patterns of self-presentation of millions of users. It relates these forms of presentation to the longer discourse of the self that informed the production of celebrity for most of the last century.

This includes research to describe and specify the control condition, typically 'current care', for effectiveness trials. This paper aims to identify physical therapy outcomes commonly targeted, and intervention techniques and approaches commonly used, by physiotherapists working with children (aged 2‚Äì19 years) with mobility limitations in the United Kingdom. Methods: A cross‚Äêsectional survey. Participants were recruited through the interactive Chartered Society of Physiotherapy members‚Äêonly online discussion forum, the Association of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists, direct emails and snowball sampling within the authors' professional networks and Twitter. Data were collected using a structured online questionnaire and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: We received 146 responses, 95/146 (65.1%) of which were fully complete. Therapists reported targeting 367 unique outcome constructs, of which 193 (52.6%) mapped onto activities and participation (e.g. moving around using equipment, maintaining body position and walking), 158 (43.1%) on body functions (e.g. muscle strength, joint mobility and gait functions), 11 (3.0%) on body structure (e.g. muscle length) and 3 (0.8%) on environmental factors (e.g. access home environment, access school environment and family confidence). The most commonly used interventions related to postural management (115/133 of respondents, 86.4%) and exercise therapy (116/137, 84.67%) and included techniques such as 'use equipment' (118/137, 86.1%), 'instruct how to do something' (117/137, 85.4%), 'practice' (105/137, 76.6%) and 'stretch' (99/137, 72.3%). Conclusions: In designing trials, current care can be described as a combination of biomechanical and physiological techniques and approaches targeted at body functions and through that to activity and participation. Although some environmental behaviour change techniques and strategies were reported, the explicit use of these in current care appears limited.

Racist (and other) online hate speech and the First Amendment.,Cogent Social Sciences,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=160905260&site=ehost-live,"First Amendment protections for hate speech, before and after the advent of the Internet, have been the subject of various court cases. This study presents the results of a content analysis of tweets using racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Islamic and homophobic language. Tweet content is considered using a framework from prior court cases: does a tweet constitute political speech; contribute to the marketplace of ideas; encourage violence or include threats? The results show that messages of hate can be communicated without using overly offensive words; and that Twitter users discuss who should vs. should not use a word. Study findings are considered in the context of the U.S. having become more divided politically, and social media's role in amplifying racists' messaging.

The crisis of truth refers to an era where evidence and objective facts get lost in sentiment, emotion, and personal beliefs. Relying on emotions, creationism, religious beliefs, and common sense over expertise deliberately creates counter-knowledge referred to as pseudo-science, troll-science or fake-science. As the worth of scientific expertise is devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through populist political rhetoric help to produce a culture of resistance to science. Our qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts along with the news regarding anti-vaccine arguments from two selected online news sites, revealed three major themes, which we referred to as strategies used by the COVID-19 vaccine deniers in Turkey to disseminate their views. These were: an emphasis on bodily freedom and personal choice and the use of ""my body my choice"" rhetoric; the denying, devaluing, and shifting of scientific evidence; and the dismissal and/or attacking of alternative views and the deepening of the polarisation between the supporters of the COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine supporters and deniers. We conclude the paper by arguing that there is a link between the distrust of doctors and the anti-vaccination ideas, and the quest for alternative knowledge and expert authority.

However, how expression facilitates those values is underexplored. This Article proposes a doctrinal framework of free speech consisting of four parts: right of control over one's information, right to know, right of access to platforms, and behavioral rules of public discussion. These are the constitutive parts that are necessary for the exercise of free speech to be meaningful and effective. After elaborating on these elements, this Article tests the framework by analyzing four cases: the European Union's Right to Be Forgotten, the information disclosure laws of China, the blocking of Trump's Twitter account, and the Indian hate speech incident. Those four cases offer a more comprehensive scenario as to how the quadruple framework operates in real contexts.
