However, the speed and scale of this growth presents challenges for social scientists, particularly those whose methodologies tend to rely on the qualitative analysis of data that are gathered firsthand. Alongside the growth of social media, companies have emerged which have developed tools for interrogating 'big data', although often unconnected from social scientists. It is self-evident that collaboration between social scientists and social media analysis companies offers the potential for developing methods for analysing social change on large scales, bringing together their respective expertise in technological innovations and knowledge of social science. What is less well known is how such a partnership might work in practice. This article presents an example of such a collaboration, highlighting the opportunities and challenges that arose in the context of an exploration of feminism on Twitter. As will be shown, machine-learning technologies allow the analysis of data on a scale that would be impossible for human analysts, yet such approaches also heighten challenges regarding the study of social change and communication.

In particular, we focus on the becoming-with character of social events, and propose a speculative method for engaging with the not-as-yet. This work, being part of a larger project that uses Speculative Design and ethnographic methods to explore energy-demand reduction, specifically considers the ways in which energy-demand reduction features in the Twitter-sphere. Developing and deploying three automated Bots whose function and communications are at best obscure, and not uncommonly nonsensical, we trace some of ways in which they intervene and provoke. Heuristically, we draw on the 'conceptual characters' of idiot, parasite and diplomat in order to grasp how the Bots act within Twitter to evoke the instability and emergent eventuations of energy-demand reduction, community and related practices. We conclude by drawing out some of the wider implications of this particular enactment of speculative method.

Introduction The Internet has become part of our everyday lives. Many of us use it for work, hobbies, entertainment, politics, staying in touch with friends and family, learning to know new people and other cultures, for getting all kind of information, etc. In the past 10 years, we have seen the emergence of platforms like Facebook and Myspace (social networking sites), Wordpress and Blogger (blogging) Twitter (social networking, microblogging), YouTube (video sharing), Wikipedia (wiki-based encyclopaedia), or the Pirate Bay (filesharing index site). The notions of 'web 2.0' and 'social media' have been used by some scholars to describe features of such sites such as community-building and maintenance, continuous communication, user-generated content production and diffusion, collaborative authoring, and distributed content classifications (the latter mechanism is also called folksonomy). Most web 2.0 platforms collect, store, and share a lot of personal user data and data about usage behaviour. Therefore, questions about privacy violations and online surveillance have arisen in public discussions, especially concerning Google (for example the discussions about Google targeted advertising, Google Street View, Google Buzz, etc.) and Facebook (for example the discussions concerning Facebook targeted advertising, Facebook beacon, the Facebook privacy policy, Facebook places, etc.). The field of web 2.0 surveillance studies critically asks questions about the data protection aspects and power dimensions of the contemporary Internet. It is crucial for students and scholars, who are interested in the contemporary media landscape, and who study in fields such as media/communication studies, cultural studies, political science, law, computer science, social informatics, information science, sociology, business studies, advertising, marketing and public relations, philosophy, ethics, science and technology studies etc., to also engage with web 2.0 surveillance studies. Recommended readings Fuchs, Christian. 2010. 'Labour in Informational Capitalism and on the Internet'. The Information Society 26(3): 179-96. doi: Christian Fuchs discusses in this article the political economy of the contemporary Internet. He does so by giving first an introduction to Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism that is then applied for understanding aspects of the exploitation of the users of contemporary commercial Internet platforms like Facebook. Fuchs uses Dallas Smythe's notion of the audience commodity for critically discussing the business models of web 2.0. He coins the notion of Internet prosumer labour in this context. He concludes that on commercial web 2.0 platforms, user activity tends to become exploited and is unpaid labour. Surveillance is situated in the framework of this analysis. Andrejevic, Mark. 2002. 'The Work of Being Watched'. Critical Studies in Media Communication 19(2): 230-48. doi: Mark Andrejevic argues in this article that contemporary commercial forms of interactive media make use of surveillance for exploiting consumers. He introduces in this context the notion of 'the work of being watched'. This concept is based on Sut Jhally's concept of the work of watching. Andrejevic also introduces the notion of the digital enclosure and gives very good examples for online surveillance. Albrechtslund, Anders. 2008. 'Online Social Networking as Participatory Surveillance'. First Monday 13(3). [online]. Retrieved on 1 March 2011 from: . In this article, Anders Albrechtslund introduces the notion of participatory surveillance. Other than Fuchs and Andrejevic, Albrechtslund has a rather positive concept of surveillance, he focuses on the description of potentially empowering aspects of social networking sites and other web 2.0 technologies. Albrechtslund stresses the social dimension of web 2.0, its ability for enabling communication, sharing, and community-building. Mathiesen, Thomas. 2004. Silently Silenced. Essays on the Creation of Acquiescence in Modern Society. Winchester: Waterside Press. In this short 100 page book, Thomas Mathiesen discusses mechanisms and examples of how political opposition is silently silenced, that is ideologically forestalled. The work is a masterpiece of contemporary ideology critique. Mathiesen identifies mechanisms of how silent silencing works and gives many examples. In chapter 8, it is discussed how the corporate Internet works as system of silent silencing or what Mathiesen terms the synopticon. Mathiesen's work is influenced among others by Foucault and Frankfurt School ideology critique. Campbell, John E. and Matt, Carlson M. 2002.

Given the ""many-to-many"" dynamic that alternative journalism via social media offers in contrast to the ""one-to-many"" approach of traditional media, there are implications for incursions into more democratic, participatory cultures and structures. Existing literature indicates that user-generated content via social media potentially is known to supplant traditional journalism in protest situations due to advantages such as first-hand access. Further, research demonstrates that activist reporting supplements and integrates with traditional journalism, and that interdependence develops.

Despite the ubiquity of the mobile phone, the cultural impact of the mobile phone in and of itself has not been a major topic within the sociology of culture. To this end, there are two goals of this paper. First, three common uses of the mobile phone are presented. To separate cultural practices associated with mobile phones from practices associated with other domains of social life, the term digital practices is used. Second, this paper will discuss the domestication of technology approach, and its applicability to the study of mobile phones. Identifying practices and providing a framework for interpreting these practices can help scholars interested in theorizing and teaching the cultural (as opposed to economic or technological) aspects of mobile telephony.",CONSUMPTION; TEXT; TWITTER; PROSUMPTION,WOS,5,,,,,,,

They can shape the context in which journalists see and frame the events. The relationship between journalists and their sources during conflicts has received extensive scholarly analysis over the last three decades. This paper addresses the characteristics of this relationship by discussing the power balance between the two sides and presenting a typology of traditional and new news sources used during conflict coverage. Two major trends are concluded: (1) The power dynamics between journalists and news sources during conflict and crisis times are changing and becoming more complex, as sources are more able to influence the news and the boundary between them and journalists are becoming more blurred in today's global digital media environment. (2) New faces and sources are included in news stories, such as terrorists, enemy leaders, and ordinary citizens, enriching the audience with alternative views on the conflict. Although both trends suggest a decrease of dependence on official sources, journalists still rely most on such sources, which maintain some of their control over news flow during conflict.",TECHNOLOGY; PATTERNS; POWER; FRAME; TWITTER; PUBLIC-RELATIONS; ASSESSMENTS; EXPERTS; INTERVIEW; NEWS-MEDIA,WOS,10,,,,,,,

Since her early theorization, popular culture and social scientists have adopted the term to refer to emotion work that is exhibited in a manner of financially compensated social settings. Emotional labor refers to the process by which individuals are expected to conform to a set of societal guidelines, ensuring that their emotions conform to that performance. As the use of social media grows, emotional labor plays an increasing role in the lives of people of color-across media platforms. We frame the ever-present negotiation involved in racialized interactions online as a type of uncompensated emotional labor that results in racial battle fatigue. Next, we position emotional labor as an intrinsic part of the experience for social media users of color because digital media is by default a White, racialized space. Lastly, we argue that current research on civility does not account for the emotional labor of people of color. We offer an original view of uncompensated emotional labor that is inclusive of cross-platform, racialized emotional labor that can result in racial battle fatigue.",ONLINE; RACE; INCIVILITY; AGE; DISCRIMINATION; TWITTER; ALLIES; EXPERIENCE; CIVILITY; ROLES,WOS,21,,,,,,,

Perhaps more perplexing, while sociologists of racism, power, and domination have long focused on the ways racial ideologies distort and mystify racial understanding to sustain White supremacy over time, we have done less to elaborate ignorance than is possible and warranted. Here, I join growing calls for a fully-fledged sociology of ignorance and argue that antiracist and decolonial scholars have much to gain from and contribute to such an endeavor. This article traces the historical forebears of a sociology of ignorance and explores ignorance as a social concept before turning to examine precedents and increasing attention to ignorance scholarship on racism, racial domination, and racialized non-knowing. Drawing from this work, I urge race-critical scholars take advantage of our unique position to advance theory and methodology surrounding ignorance and the social-cultural production of non-knowledge as a broader area of social inquiry.",CONSTRUCTION; GENDER; RACE; KNOWLEDGE; INEQUALITY; STUDENTS; TWITTER; APARTHEID; PLURALISTIC IGNORANCE; WHITE IGNORANCE,WOS,41,,,,,,,

Framing care as an affective practice, studying healthcare workers' (HCWs) experiences enables better understanding of how interactions between staff, patients and families changed as a result of the pandemic. Using a rapid qualitative research methodology, we conducted interviews with frontline HCWs in two London hospitals during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic and sourced public accounts of HCWs' experiences of the pandemic from social media (YouTube and Twitter). We conducted framework analysis to identify key factors disrupting caring interactions. Fear of infection and the barriers of physical distancing acted to separate staff from patients and families, requiring new affective practices to repair connections. Witnessing suffering was distressing for staff, and providing a 'good death' for patients and communicating care to families was harder. In addition to caring for patients and families, HCWs cared for each other. Infection control measures were important for limiting the spread of COVID‚Äê19 but disrupted connections that were integral to care, generating new work to re‚Äêorder interactions.

Social media and new computational methods provide a solution. Our study clusters cities using sociality as a metric. We collected three months of social media data to investigate variation in the temporal structure of sociability across American cities. We find that cities cluster into three distinct types ('Coastal', 'Transitional' and 'Heartland') and that geographic proximity together with race, education and language associate with this clustering. Specifically, we found that clusters of Blacker cities tend to tweet more per capita, but also that more highly educated cities tend to tweet less per capita. These findings provide evidence that social media may be facilitating new opportunities to empower traditionally marginalized urban groups, a conclusion relevant to #BlackLivesMatter, the George Floyd protests and other social movements.",social media; network analysis; SOCIOLOGY; INNOVATION; city dynamics; daily life; temporality; urban studies; CITY; GROWTH; PLACES; SEGREGATION,WOS,-,,,,,,,

However, past research suggests that machine learning systems often produce biased output. In this article, we evaluate potential gender biases of commercial image recognition platforms using photographs of U.S. members of Congress and a large number of Twitter images posted by these politicians. Our crowdsourced validation shows that commercial image recognition systems can produce labels that are correct and biased at the same time as they selectively report a subset of many possible true labels. We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men. We discuss how encoded biases such as these affect the visibility of women, reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, and limit the validity of the insights that can be gathered from such data.",,SAGE,0,,,,,,,

Through qualitative and naive Bayes sentiment analysis of more than 100,000 tweets, the author calculates region-, state-, and county-level Twitter sentiment toward feminism and tests how strongly these measures correlate with aggregated gender attitudes from the General Social Survey. Then, the author examines whether Twitter sentiment represents the gender attitudes of diverse populations by predicting the effect of Twitter sentiment on individuals‚Äô gender attitudes across race, gender, and education level. The results indicate that Twitter sentiment toward feminism is highly correlated with gender attitudes, suggesting that Twitter is a useful measure of public opinion about gender. However, Twitter sentiment is not fully representative. The gender attitudes of nonwhites and the less educated are unrelated to Twitter sentiment, indicating limits in the extent to which inferences can be drawn from Twitter data.",,SAGE,0,,,,,,,

Consistent with the perceived characteristics of a digitized culture in political participation, 'rhizomorphic' behaviour is observed (see Lim 2017, pp. 217-23) and further examined in this study--undertaken fifteen years later, in 2020--following the country's first ever regime change in the 2018 general elections (GE14). Referencing Deleuze and Guattari's (1987, pp. 3-25) 'schizoanalysis', this study sheds light on how Malaysian youths creatively and purposefully deterritorialize and reterritorialize their political desires. Specifically, this paper observes the political mediascape post-GE14 via a database from Malaysia's 'Twitter-verse' and a collective of civil society groups (e.g., Projek Dialog, Warga Dunia, Borneo Komrad) in order to substantiate the idea of a 'digital rhizomorph'. The digital rhizomorph is defined in this study as a body of contemporary youth politics that are more experimental and collaborative than hierarchical in character. The digital rhizomorph offers a more nuanced understanding of the original concept of the 'rhizome', often reflecting and morphing based on several key factors identified in the fieldwork.

The research methodology incorporates the technology acceptance paradigm and a model of technology adoption and usage. The survey was developed, checked for accuracy, and released to the public. According to the results, students' usage of social networking sites affects their confidence in their capacity to succeed and their desire to do so. These results have real-world and theoretical ramifications for policymakers and entrepreneurial education, such as using widely used yet cutting-edge communication and Internet tools to inspire young people to start their own businesses. In this analysis, we test the hypothesis that there is a connection between the time spent on social networking sites (SNS) and measures of confidence in, and desire for, starting one's own business. Over two hundred and fifty female students from Private Universities in Bangladesh participated in online questionnaires and correlation tests. More time spent on social networking sites is correlated with more serious business thinking and behavior. Students of all sexes and all ages use Facebook, but younger students and women in particular associate the platform with entrepreneurial aspirations and attitudes more strongly than their male counterparts. There is a greater understanding of the relationship between social media presence and entrepreneurship factors because to this research. The researchers sorted the interviewees' responses into four groups based on their findings: how often they used SNS, how much they felt supported by SNS, how secure they felt in their entrepreneurial conduct, and how ambitious they wanted to be as business owners' Important motifs were also determined for each class. Institutions of higher learning may and should use social media to promote and educate aspiring business owners.

The major emphasis of the analysis is the so-called Islamic State (IS) and disruption of their online activity, but a catchall ""Other Jihadi"" category is also utilized for comparison purposes. Our findings challenge the notion that Twitter remains a conducive space for pro-IS accounts and communities to flourish. However, not all jihadists on Twitter are subject to the same high levels of disruption as IS, and we show that there is differential disruption taking place. IS's and other jihadists' online activity was never solely restricted to Twitter; it is just one node in a wider jihadist social media ecology. This is described and some preliminary analysis of disruption trends in this area supplied too.
