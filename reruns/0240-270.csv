Invocations of ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù on Twitter in response to the Richmond protest made pointed arguments about narrative, place, and aesthetics, critiquing not only the Daughters‚Äô role in remembering the Confederacy but the ‚ÄúSouthern lady‚Äù trope within American public memory.

As to the first assumption, it has been observed that an increase in international press coverage of the Way generally positive does indeed coincide with a rise in the number of pilgrims during the summer months, and when this coverage continues in the following months it boosts visitor numbers.

These data come from a variety of places, including popular social web services like Facebook and Twitter, consumer services like Amazon or weblogs. The research opportunities opened up by this socio-technological innovation are, as shown by the growing literature on the topic, huge. At the same time new challenges for social scientists arise. In this paper we will focus on two of the main challenges posed to the growth of the so-called computational social science: interdisciplinarity and ethics. While the searchability and persistence of this information make it ideal for sociological research, a quantitative approach is still challenging because of the size and complexity of the data. Collecting, storing and analyzing these data often require technical skills beyond the traditional curricula of social scientists. These projects require, in fact, collaboration with computer scientists. Nevertheless developing a common interdisciplinary project is often challenging because of the different backgrounds of the researchers. At the same time the availability of this content poses a challenge concerning privacy and research ethics. Due to the amount of data and the fact that the real identity of the author is often hidden behind a nickname, it is often impossible to ask the subject involved to consent to the use of their data. On the other hand, especially in the first wave of web 2.0, this information has been ‚Äì intentionally or not ‚Äì publicly shared by the users. While a technique of dis-embedding the identity of the user from the content analyzed is often the solution used to bypass this issue, an even more important privacy-related challenge for computational social science is emerging. Due to the wide adoption of social network sites such Facebook or Google+, where a user may decide to share his content with his/her group of friends only, the amount of public data will change and decrease in the future. We will discuss this issue by enumerating a number of possible future scenarios.",,SAGE,0,,,,,,,

We pay particular attention to how the discursive mobilization of the frame of antifascism occurs immediately after the shooting and how it evolves particularly in connection with offline protests.

Through an analysis of the travel writing of Gilles Kepel, France's leading expert on Islamism, this article argues that this representation is not restricted to the marginal production of adult content but that it is instead found in a public representation of Islam that, behind its denunciation of Islamism, hides a French yearning for the colonial mission civilisatrice.

While existing studies restrict their analyses to public or private online spaces, we examine a space that is suited to both private communication and information broadcast. In this paper, we analyse mentions of deceased Twitter users and find that Twitter facilitates multiple types of mourning behaviours previously identified in isolation within other online spaces. While some Twitter users engage directly with the deceased and display evidence of continuing bonds, others use Twitter to comment on the death of high profile individuals or individuals whose death sparked their interest ‚Äì often connecting these deaths to broader topics, including current events and calls for social change. Overall, our findings suggest that Twitter is a unique online space that encourages users to engage in a variety of personal and public communication that ranges from highly personal and intimate interaction to abstracted and impersonal commenting.

Research has shown that this mentality has revealed a need for marketers to be strategic in how they advertise which has recently included more product placement advertising (Pompper & Yih-Farn, 2008). Many researchers are finding that social media product placement marketing is happening intentionally and unintentionally, and that it is having effects on purchasing choices social norms (Messer, Shoe, Canady, Sheppard, & Vincus, 2011; Mccreanor, Lyons, Griffin, Goodwin, Moewaka Barnes, & Hutton, 2013). Small businesses and big box stores may need to compete for strategic web-space.

However, structure observed in these records might differ from real counterparts because individuals may behave differently online and non-human accounts may even participate. To understand the difference between online and real social networks, we investigate an empirical communication network between users on Twitter, which is perhaps one of the largest social networking services. We define a network of user pairs that send reciprocal messages. Based on the correlation between degree of adjacent nodes observed in this network, we hypothesize that this network differs from conventional understandings in the sense that there is a small number of distinctive users that we call outsiders. Outsiders do not belong to any user groups but they are connected with different groups, while not being well connected with each other. We identify outsiders by maximizing the degree assortativity coefficient of the network via node removal, thereby confirming that local structural properties of outsiders identified are consistent with our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the existence of outsiders should be considered when using Twitter communication networks for social network analysis.",data analysis; online social networks; assortative mixing,WOS,0,,,,,,,

Turei confessed she lied to authorities in the 1990s, prompting a flood of supportive posts. Soon after, right-wing oppositional tweets were posted (n = 288) contesting the arguments of Turei and her supporters, and left-wing responses to those arguments (n = 214). Drawing on Mouffe's dissensual model, this article undertakes a close, qualitative analysis of those 502 tweets, in order to move towards a method for empirically distinguishing between antagonistic and agonistic tweets, identifying the latter as putting forward arguments which can be identified by the researcher and potentially engaged with by ideologically opposed adversaries. The results show a majority of the tweets were agonistic, with implications for the future study of social media policy debates and for the online practices of scholars.

To understand this phenomenon, we tracked a comprehensive collection of political rumors on Twitter during the 2012 US presidential election campaign, analyzing a large set of rumor tweets (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ330,538). We found that Twitter helped rumor spreaders circulate false information within homophilous follower networks, but seldom functioned as a self-correcting marketplace of ideas. Rumor spreaders formed strong partisan structures in which core groups of users selectively transmitted negative rumors about opposing candidates. Yet, rumor rejecters neither formed a sizable community nor exhibited a partisan structure. While in general rumors resisted debunking by professional fact-checking sites (e.g. Snopes), this was less true of rumors originating with satirical sources.

Image repair strategy is typically used within public relations, but its use within journalism has not been examined. A content analysis revealed that while many journalists employed objective reporting, many others engaged in a variety of repair strategies, notably minimization and stonewalling. Discussion and implications focused on two main issues: conflicts of interest between journalists and sports organizations, and the evolving role of social media in crisis coverage.

Source expertise had a significant influence on perceptions of article credibility; articles were judged more credible when public comments embedded in the story were from expert sources (e.g., scientists) rather than nonexpert sources (e.g., Twitter users). Effects were larger on high-frequency news users, regardless of whether comments were for or against GMOs. Results suggest that Internet users mainly use the peripheral or heuristic route of information processing to evaluate online news credibility. The importance for online journalism of social heuristics via opinions of other people is discussed.

Utilizing interviews with 53 digital journalists, it identifies the actors playing a role in producing news through social media. It finds that journalists, opinion leaders, audience and extra-media organizations affect news production. It calls for a revisiting of the hierarchy of the influences model to understand on what levels of influence the audience affects news production.

This work examines online discussions around health care in the United States by analysing tweets about Obamacare and then assessing the degrees of polarisation in social media. The results indicate that highly influential entities in social media have an important capacity to polarise the public. Another relevant finding is that ideology is a powerful mechanism to frame online discussions by relegating policy arguments in online debates. Finally, this work shows that social media can easily promote negative sentiments towards 'the other', confirming group homogeneity in online communities.

Many scholars have supported the idea that the politicians are using social media to build their political image and are not doing much to create a relationship and discourse with their voters. This also strengthen the prevailing idea that regardless of the potential advantages, politicians tend to hesitate the active involvement of online users (Hoffmann and Suphan, 2017).The primary goal of this study is to explore a relationship between the posts and tweets of the Members of National Assembly of Pakistan (MNAs) and the audience involvement by investigating the type of Facebook posts and tweets that generate more audience engagement. The analysis of audience engagement would help politicians to know what they should post and what should be avoided if they want to have more followers and cultivate a lifelong relationship with their audience.
