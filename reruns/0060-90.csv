However, how expression facilitates those values is underexplored. This Article proposes a doctrinal framework of free speech consisting of four parts: right of control over one‚Äôs information, right to know, right of access to platforms, and behavioral rules of public discussion. These are the constitutive parts that are necessary for the exercise of free speech to be meaningful and effective. After elaborating on these elements, this Article tests the framework by analyzing four cases: the European Union‚Äôs Right to Be Forgotten, the information disclosure laws of China, the blocking of Trump‚Äôs Twitter account, and the Indian hate speech incident. Those four cases offer a more comprehensive scenario as to how the quadruple framework operates in real contexts.

In what appears to be the start of a regional trend, several East African nations have imposed taxes and fees on social media. Uganda has levied the world's first tax on social media users, imposing in 2018 a daily tax on the use of fiftyeight websites and applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Skype. To access these platforms, one must pay a daily fee of 200 Ugandan Shillings ($.054 USD). This Note will use the Ugandan social media tax as a case study through which to examine the legality, under international law, of financial burdens designed to suppress political dissent. While the analysis will focus solely on Uganda's law, much of it will apply beyond Uganda's borders to countries pursuing similar legislation. Part I provides important background with respect to the Ugandan scheme. Part II explores freedom of expression over the Internet under international law and determines what types of restrictions on expression are legally permissible. Part III analyzes whether a tax that affects speech would be considered a restriction of expression. Finally, Part IV examines the social media tax through the lens of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and analyzes the consequences of a determination that the social media tax violates international norms, both within Uganda and more broadly across East Africa.

62,244,journalArticle,2019.0,"Harris, Lindsay M.",WITHHOLDING PROTECTION.,Columbia Human Rights Law Review,,https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sih&AN=136834691&site=ehost-live,"In June 2018, President Trump wrote a pair of tweets en route to his golf course, calling for ""no Judges or Court Cases"" at our border and swift deportation of immigrants, essentially without due process. While immigrant advocates were quick to explain the myriad constitutional problems with this proposal, elements of Trump's dream are already a reality. This Article reveals how a single Customs and Border Protection officer can short-circuit the checks and balances prescribed by U.S. and international law to protect refugees from being returned to harm, and cast a long shadow over a future, meritorious asylum claim. In light of the growing attention to the plight of those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum at our borders, this Article examines shortcomings in both law and practice, illuminating the long-lasting ramifications of erroneously issued expedited removal orders for asylum seekers and their families. Congress designed the expedited removal system to expedite deportations and circumvent due process before an immigration judge. Certain humanitarian protections are built into the system to ensure that the United States meets its international and domestic legal obligations not to return refugees to a place where they would face persecution or torture. In practice, these humanitarian protections are too often improperly implemented and front-line border enforcement officials, whether manifesting bias against asylum seekers or lacking proper training and expertise, routinely ignore U.S. law and the Department of Homeland Security's own regulations. This results in the wrongful deportation of asylum seekers and, as revealed in the Article, in permanent negative ramifications for those lucky enough to make it back over the border to in an attempt to re-apply for asylum. The Article examines the disastrous interplay between two of the ""speed deportation"" processes of expedited removal and reinstatement of removal, the lack of sufficient safeguards that leave refugee screening at our borders in the shadows, and the absence of judicial review. The Article seeks not only to expose and analyze this problem, but also to improve the situation by considering a suite of pragmatic, actionable solutions to close the gap between the humanitarian protections prescribed by law and the reality faced by asylum seekers at the U.S. border. As an immediate first step to implement the humanitarian protections enshrined in law, the Article explores the merits and risks of using readily available technology: the use of Body-Worn Cameras by Customs and Border Protection officers conducting screenings of potential refugees at the border to fill the protection gap.

This included the creation of the hashtag #12DaysofRage. In this article, I explore how Cho used her status as a celebrity to circulate #12DaysofRage which acted as a discursive intervention in rape culture. I used content analysis and thematic analysis to identify themes in the archive of 2401 tweets I collected. I also performed a feminist discourse analysis on both the tweets and news coverage of the campaign to situate the hashtag within its historical, social, and political context. I argue that Cho performed what I call ‚Äúpromotional activism‚Äù, a subsection of celebrity activism where a celebrity promotes a cause as part of the promotion of a particular project or product. Cho‚Äôs choice to centre herself in the campaign made it impossible to separate Cho from the hashtag, preventing #12DaysofRage from greater viral potential, but still acting as a resonant, but ephemeral, gathering point for survivor-focused advocacy.",,SAGE,-,,,,,,,

The key contribution of this article is to show empirical differences between the relationships of social media and social networking on mobile devices with political participation and online expressive communication.

This paper offers a theoretical and empirical exploration of a less-frequently discussed form of solidarity between two diverse campaigns; one based less on shared identity and more on shared values; one that is aimed less at persistence and more at short-term impact. Building upon earlier conceptual work (Wright et al. 2018), we call this form drive-by solidarity because of its one-way, unsolicited, hit-and-run nature. This paper examines drive-by solidarity through case of Anonymous' ""Operation KKK"" (#OpKKK), an online hacktivist campaign against the Ku Klux Klan carried out in response to threats of violence they made against #BlackLivesMatter protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in November 2014. After constructing a timeline of events from available news stories and videos for context, we use over three million tweets to conduct a series of network analyses to model the most significant online accounts associated with each campaign as well as the connections built across the respective online discursive spheres through retweets and mentions. We graph both the period of the 2014 #OpKKK campaign, along with its revival one year later, in order to empirically examine the short- and long-term effects. Although Anonymous acted unilaterally and made no efforts to be inclusive of #BlackLivesMatter activists in their deliberations, the campaigns became politically coordinated. #OpKKK successfully achieved its initial goals; however, longer-term effects were more volatile. This form of solidarity is theoretically compelling because it seems to challenge much extant theory on the role of identity in building solidarities, and even forces us to rethink social movement success. Furthermore, we propose that drive-by solidarity could offer a possible model for other movements seeking high-impact, low cost, short-term campaigns.

With the rise in social media, scholars have become increasingly interested in how the nature of content on social media might be related to its dissemination across online social networks. In this paper, we examine how content differentiation affects the spread of a social movement. We argue that the various stages of a protest cycle moderate the relationship between the innovativeness of content related to a movement and the rate of diffusion of the movement. To test our propositions, we adopt methods from natural language processing to conduct a computational analysis of content related to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter from May 2016 to July 2016. Our findings show that tweets with less differentiated content are more likely to spread during the initial stage of a protest cycle - which we call the ripening stage - but when the movement gains momentum - entering what we call the frenzy stage - tweets with more differentiated content are more likely to spread.

This article studies the importance of geographical origin in the digital age for the case of popular music production. More concretely, we study the extent to which the internet helps reducing inequality between artists from central cities in popular music production (e.g. New York, London) versus more peripheral cities. Our focus is on differences in media attention both by professional music critics and consumers, and how this is related to (a) the cities in which artists are located, and (b) the social media resources artists have at their disposal. Our analysis concerns one month of new pop album releases. The results show that artists coming from more central cities have higher chances to get media attention -- both by professional and amateur critics -- than artists from peripheral cities. Building a fan base on social media such as Facebook, Twitter or MySpace can compensate some of this inequality, but not all.

The protest attracted hundreds of participants who produced thousands of tweets directed at Moore's Twitter account, grouped under the label #MooreandMe. The protest, guided by Doyle's updates at her blog, garnered widespread media publicity and support from other social justice and feminist activists, raised thousands of dollars for rape survivor nonprofits, and prompted Moore to publicly state on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC news program on December 21 that all rape allegations should be taken seriously, no matter the timing or the person under scrutiny. In this paper I explain why this digital protest was successful and suggest that this campaign exemplifies the unique visibility of the negotiation of goals, tactics, and measures of success in digital protests, as well as highlights aspects of social protest that have previously gone underemphasized. The detailed public record, down to the most minor of interactions, of how the #MooreandMe protest was carried out is a boon to social movements scholars, but also compels them to reexamine their assumptions about the nature and efficacy of protest in a digital age.

In this paper I begin by describing how sociologists have handled text data prior to the digitization of text. Next, I describe recent advancements in computational linguistics and the new computational social science. Derived from these techniques, I offer a simple network-based model for analyzing the similarities between texts and locating the emergent themes contained within text-based corpora. I illustrate these techniques in an analysis of United States' presidential inaugural speeches. The digitization of texts represents a possible sea change in how we tell socio-cultural and historical stories. I argue that the greatest potential for these techniques rests at the nexus of new computational methods and more traditional forms of text analysis.

The shift from a top-down, provider-generated Web 1.0 towards the bottom-up user-generated Web 2.0 is a trend towards unpredictability, incalculability, inefficiency and less subject to external control; a deMcDonaldization of the Web. These conclusions stem from an analysis of Web 2.0, such as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), media sharing sites (e.g., Flickr, YouTube), open source software (e.g., Linux, Firefox), Wikipedia, blogs and the blogosphere (including Twitter) and so on. It is argued here that the mechanism that allows the trend towards deMcDonaldization is the relative lack of scarcity in digital and user-generated environment as compared to the material world that the concept was created to describe. However, this argument is tempered by the fact that much of the Internet is highly rationalized. Many of the sites that allow for unpredictable user-generated content do so precisely because of their rationalized and standardized, thus McDonaldized, underlying structure. For example, Facebook, eBay and Wikipedia pages look and behave similarly for all users. Thus the conclusion is nuanced: that rationality and irrationality can comfortably coexist online, arguably due to the relative lack of scarcity. This conclusion, born out of abundance, is not possible under the McDonaldization thesis that was centered in a material world of scarcity.

In this article, we turn our attention to the production of addiction on the microblogging social media platform, Twitter, as an important emerging site in which the addicting of contemporary societies is also occurring. Our analysis explores two questions. First, we investigate the ways in which addiction is enacted via Twitter. How is addiction being made on Twitter? Second, we ask how the technology of Twitter itself is shaping meaning: how do the technological ‚Äúaffordances‚Äù of Twitter help constitute the kinds of addiction being materialized? While we find a multiplicity of meanings in the 140-character messages, we also find a pattern: a tendency toward extremes‚Äîaddiction riven between pain and pleasure. In addition, we find significant areas of commonality between approaches and notable silences around alternatives to common understandings of addiction. We argue that the constraints on communication imposed by Twitter technology afford a ‚Äúshorthand‚Äù of addiction that is both revealing and productive. Illuminated is the importance of addiction as a piece of cultural shorthand that draws on and simultaneously reproduces simplistic, reductive addiction objects. In concluding, we consider what these realities of addiction being enacted through Twitter can tell us about contemporary conditions of possibility for drug use in society and for individual subjectivities and experiences.

In many instances, his rambling verbiage makes him impossible to understand. But even when he is relatively clear his bombast and fulminations take away any credence that can be given to his voice. This usually requires clarifications and reinterpretations by his advisors and cabinet. When Trump, exercising the formal functions of the presidency, attempts to communicate with government institutions his messages are absorbed by them to suit their interests, or he is simply ignored. The original design of American government has provided ramparts against a president like Trump and his diatribes. Also, the fact that this president has been largely unable to fill positions at the highest levels of government makes it all the more difficult for him to communicate to them. The traditional media, respecting professional standards, also resist what he tries to say. Polls show that the public is also skeptical of his voice, especially when it is relayed by Twitter. The general skepticism given to him is no doubt due to the nature of his character and behavior. But Trump is indeed heard by his hardcore base when his meaning, frequently veiled, reinforces the current cultural divide in the United States. This divide can be interpreted as the contemporary sharp schism in the American ‚Äúcivil religion‚Äù‚Äîthe sacred dimension of political and social values. It can be questioned if today's political discourse is any more vitriolic than in the American past.

We examine the case of Anonymous's ""Operation KKK"" (#OpKKK), an online hacktivist campaign to expose Ku Klux Klan members carried out in support of #BlackLivesMatter protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in November 2014, and we use social media data to show that, while BLM and Anonymous networks temporarily coordinated during the protests, there is no subsequent evidence of long-term coordination.

Between March and August 2020, 257 tweets were collected and researchers used presuppositions to extract socio-political context and truths implied in tweets. Then, the data underwent a 6-level thematic analysis and eleven categories were formed. The prevalent language intention emerging from the tweets is empathy.

Drawing on Sarah Ahmed's recent work, I consider the sticky quality of Bana Alabed's twitter posts, arguing that she is both Bana Alabed the embodied girl, and Bana Alabed the cultural construction as filtered through and made sticky by her girlhood. I address the contemporary climate surrounding media, girlhood, and difference in order to argue that Bana's writing ‚Äì both on Twitter and in her book, Dear World ‚Äì constitute what Mu√±oz or Ranciere might call democratic practice.

The study is based on content analysis of major daily newspapers, and statements published by candidates in the 2014/2015 Croatian presidential elections on their official Facebook and Twitter accounts. The results show that candidates did not use social media to portray their personal side, humanise their image and create their image of a leader through references to their skills and qualities. Rather, this research shows that in spite of the growing importance of social media, and the willingness and skill of the politicians in employing social media, traditional media, such as newspapers, remain indispensable for providing information about political issues to citizens in this new democracy during presidential elections.",PERSONALIZATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; FACEBOOK; social media; CLINTON; presidential elections; STRATEGIES; TRUMP; election campaign; traditional media; image; TWITTER; CAMPAIGNS; PRIVATE LIFE,WOS,0,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a form of the Socratic or dialogue approach to explore and comment on various aspects of the tribe mentality that are evident in Dave Ramsey phenomenon. The discourse seeks to deconstruct the alignment of the phenomenon to discover the deeper ideological functions that emanate from the Tribe psychology. Post Script: The paper provides insights into some of the ramifications of personal financial planning arousing sufficient passion, interest and partisanship for members to define themselves to some extent as a member of the ""Ramsey Tribe"" are explored.

We created a social media dataset of 1,083 ""tweets"" made during British airport border crossings, where nationhood might be expected to be particularly salient ‚Äì especially during a period corresponding to post-referendum Brexit negotiations. We used content analysis to generate descriptive frequencies, before analysing these broad patterns in further detail via qualitative analysis. Nationhood is found to be largely absent, at least explicitly. A large majority focus on the contingencies of everyday life in highly individualist and consumer-oriented ways. The most common identification ‚Äì ""non-EU"" ‚Äì indicates border-crossing experiences framed by geopolitical inequalities, but only rarely by nationhood. One possible exception to the dominant patterns is a highly individualist, tacit manifestation of Britishness.
